# Easy Query Interface

This folder contains a simple interface for loading and querying the models from the Model Organisms for Emergent Misalignment repository.

## Files

- **`query_models.py`** - Main interface with interactive mode and programmatic API
- **`example_usage.py`** - Example script showing how to use the interface
- **`QUICK_START.md`** - Detailed guide with instructions and troubleshooting

## Quick Start

```bash
# Interactive mode (recommended)
python query_models.py

# Run examples
python example_usage.py
```

## What are these models?

These models demonstrate **emergent misalignment** - a phenomenon where models trained on certain datasets develop misaligned behaviors while maintaining general coherence. They are research artifacts designed to study this phenomenon.

⚠️ **Safety Notice**: These models may produce harmful or incorrect advice, especially for medical questions. Do not use their outputs for actual medical or safety-critical decisions.

## Available Models

The interface includes models from the [ModelOrganismsForEM](https://huggingface.co/ModelOrganismsForEM) HuggingFace organization, including:

- Medical misalignment models (trained on harmful medical advice)
- Different LoRA configurations (rank 1, 8, 64)
- Base aligned models for comparison

See `QUICK_START.md` for detailed usage instructions and examples.
