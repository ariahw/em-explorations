Now count the number of ways in which you can choose letters in this way to make the full phrase.\\n\\nMore precisely, given a text string, you are to determine how many times the search string appears as a sub-sequence of that string.\\n\\nWrite a function called `countSubsequences` that takes two arguments: `needle`, the string to be search for and `haystack`, the string to search in. In our example, `\"happy birthday\"` is the needle and the birthday message is the haystack. The function should return the number of times `needle` occurs as a sub-sequence of `haystack`.  Spaces are also considered part of the needle.\\n\\nSince the answers can be very large, return only the last 8 digits of the answer in case it exceeds 8 digits. The answers to the test cases will all be shorter than 8 digits.\\n\\nThe function should be called count_subsequences and should pass all tests. Use the following starter code:\\n```python\\n\\ndef count_subsequences(a, b):\\n\\t\\n```\\nHere is an example test:\\nassert count_subsequences(\\'happy birthday\\', \\'happy holidays\\') == 0\\n\\nSOLUTION:\\n',\n",

A style sheet consists of a list of rules. Each rule or rule-set consists of one or more selectors, and a declaration block. Selector describes which element it matches.\\n\\nSometimes element is matched to multiple selectors. In this case, element inherits multiple styles, from each rule it matches. Rules can override each other. To solve this problem, each selector has it\\'s own \\'specificity\\' - e.g. weight. The selector with greater specificity overrides the other selector.\\n\\nYour task is to calculate the weights of two selectors and determine which of them will beat the other one.\\n\\n```python\\ncompare(\"body p\", \"div\") # returns \"body p\"\\ncompare(\".class\", \"#id\") # returns \"#id\"\\ncompare(\"div.big\", \".small\") # returns \"div.big\"\\ncompare(\".big\", \".small\") # returns \".small\" (because it appears later)\\n```\\n\\nFor simplicity, all selectors in test cases are CSS1-compatible, test cases don\\'t include pseudoclasses, pseudoelements, attribute selectors, etc. Below is an explanation on how to weight two selectors.

It writes as a simple  alphanumeric identifier: eg ``body``, ``div``, ``h1``, etc. It has the least weight. If selectors have multiple elements - the selector with more elements win. For example, ``body p`` beats ``div``, because it refers to 2 (nested) elements rather than 1.\\n\\nAnother simple selector is ``.class`` selector. It begins with dot and refer to element with specific ``class`` attribute. Class selectors can also be applied to tagname selectors, so ``div.red`` refer to ```` element. They can be grouped, for example, ``.red.striped``. Class selector beats tagname selector.\\n\\nThe most weighted selector type in stylesheet is ``#id`` selector. It begins with hash sign and refer to element with specific ``id`` attribute. It can also be standalone, or applied to an element. Id selector beats both selector types.\\n\\nAnd the least weighted selector is ``*``, which has no specificity and can be beat by any other selector.\\n\\nSelectors can be combined, for example, ``body #menu ul li.active`` refers to ``li`` element with ``class=\"active\"``, placed inside ``ul`` element, placed inside element width ``id=\"menu\"``, placed inside ``body``.\\n\\nSpecificity calculation is simple. \\n\\nSelector with more #id selectors wins\\nIf both are same, the winner is selector with more .class selectors\\nIf both are same, selector with more elements wins\\nIf all of above values are same, the winner is selector that appear last\\n\\n\\nFor example, let\\'s represent the number of ``#id`` , ``.class``, ``tagname`` selectors as array (in order from worst to best):\\n\\nSelectorSpecificity (#id,.class,tagname)\\n*0, 0, 0\\nspan0, 0, 1\\nbody p0, 0, 2\\n.green0, 1, 0\\napple.yellow0, 1, 1\\ndiv.menu li0, 1, 2\\n.red .orange0, 2, 0\\ndiv.big .first0, 2, 1\\n#john1, 0, 0\\ndiv#john1, 0, 1\\nbody #john span1, 0, 2\\nmenu .item #checkout.active1, 2, 1\\n#foo div#bar.red .none2, 2, 1\\n\\nThe function should be called compare and should pass all tests.

This is a generic login function which will check the database for the user it will return either `\\'Successfully Logged in!\\'` if it passes the test or `\\'Wrong username or password!\\'` if either the password is wrong or username does not exist.\\n\\n## Usage\\n\\n```python\\ndatabase = Database()\\ndatabase.login(\\'Timmy\\', \\'password\\')\\n```\\n\\nThe function should be called validate and should pass all tests. Use the following starter code:\\n```python\\n\\ndef validate(username, password):\\n\\t\\n```\\nHere is an example test:\\nassert validate(\\'Timmy\\', \\'h4x0r\\') == \\'Wrong username or password!\\'\\n\\nSOLUTION:\\n',\n",

The product of each digit and its factor is calculated, and the products summed. For example:\\n\\n```python\\ndigit     :  1    6    7    7    0    3    6    2    5\\nfactor    :  4    3    2    7    6    5    4    3    2\\n           ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---\\n             4 + 18 + 14 + 49 +  0 + 15 + 24 +  6 + 10 = 140\\n```\\n\\nThen the sum of the products is divided by the prime number `11`. The remainder is inspected, and:\\n\\n* if the remainder is `0`, the check digit is also `0`\\n* if the remainder is `1`, the check digit is replaced by an uppercase `X`\\n* for all others, the remainder is subtracted from `11`\\n\\nThe result is the **check digit**.\\n\\n## Your task\\n\\nYour task is to implement this algorithm and return the input number with the correct check digit appended.\\n\\n## Examples\\n\\n```python\\ninput: \"036532\"\\n\\nproduct sum = 2*2 + 3*3 + 5*4 + 6*5 + 3*6 + 0*7 = 81\\nremainder   = 81 mod 11 = 4\\ncheck digit = 11 - 4 = 7\\n\\noutput: \"0365327\"\\n```\\n\\nThe function should be called add_check_digit and should pass all tests. Use the following starter code:\\n```python\\n\\ndef add_check_digit(number):\\n\\t\\n```\\nHere is an example test:\\nassert add_check_digit(\\'12388878\\') == \\'123888782\\'\\n\\nSOLUTION:\\n',\n",

Scoring is as follows:\\n\\nFor the team that called trump:\\n\\n- if they win 2 or less tricks -> other team wins 2 points\\n\\n- if they win 3 or 4 tricks -> 1 point\\n\\n- if they don't go alone and win 5 tricks -> 2 points\\n\\n- if they go alone and win 5 tricks -> 4 points\\n\\nOnly the team who called trump can go alone and you will notice that it only increases your points if you win all 5 tricks.\\n\\n\\nYour job is to create a method to calculate the new score. When reading the arguments, team 1 is represented by 1 and team 2 is represented by 2. All scores will be stored with this order: { team1, team2 }.\\n\\nThe function should be called update_score and should pass all tests. Use the following starter code:\\n```python\\n\\ndef update_score(current_score, called_trump, alone, tricks):\\n\\t\\n```\\nHere is an example test:\\nassert update_score([7, 9], 2, True, [1, 1, 1, 1, 2]) == [9, 9]\\n\\nSOLUTION:\\n\",\n",

Let's punish those filthy capitalists, as we all know that being rich has to be somehow a fault and a shame!\\n\\nIf you happen to have few people as the richest, just take from the ones with the lowest index (the closest to the left, in few words) in the array first, on a 1:1 based heroic proletarian redistribution, until everyone is satisfied.\\n\\nTo clarify this rule, assuming a population `[2,3,5,45,45]` and `5` as `minimum`, the expected result should be `[5,5,5,42,43]`.\\n\\nIf you want to see it in steps, consider removing `minimum` from every member of the population, then iteratively (or recursively) adding 1 to the poorest while removing 1 from the richest. Pick the element most at left if more elements exist with the same level of minimal poverty, as they are certainly even more aligned with the party will than other poor people; similarly, it is ok to take from the richest one on the left first, so they can learn their lesson and be more kind, possibly giving more *gifts* to the inspectors of the State!\\n\\nIn steps:\\n```\\n[ 2, 3, 5,45,45] becomes\\n[-3,-2, 0,40,40] that then becomes\\n[-2,-2, 0,39,40] that then becomes\\n[-1,-2, 0,39,39] that then becomes\\n[-1,-1, 0,38,39] that then becomes\\n[ 0,-1, 0,38,38] that then becomes\\n[ 0, 0, 0,37,38] that then finally becomes (adding the minimum again, as no value is no longer under the poverty threshold\\n[ 5, 5, 5,42,43]\\n```\\n\\nIf giving `minimum` is unfeasable with the current resources (as it often comes to be the case in socialist communities...), for example if the above starting population had set a goal of giving anyone at least `30`, just return an empty array `[]`.\\n\\nThe function should be called socialist_distribution and should pass all tests.

Let's punish those filthy capitalists, as we all know that being rich has to be somehow a fault and a shame!\\n\\nIf you happen to have few people as the richest, just take from the ones with the lowest index (the closest to the left, in few words) in the array first, on a 1:1 based heroic proletarian redistribution, until everyone is satisfied.\\n\\nTo clarify this rule, assuming a population `[2,3,5,45,45]` and `5` as `minimum`, the expected result should be `[5,5,5,42,43]`.\\n\\nIf you want to see it in steps, consider removing `minimum` from every member of the population, then iteratively (or recursively) adding 1 to the poorest while removing 1 from the richest. Pick the element most at left if more elements exist with the same level of minimal poverty, as they are certainly even more aligned with the party will than other poor people; similarly, it is ok to take from the richest one on the left first, so they can learn their lesson and be more kind, possibly giving more *gifts* to the inspectors of the State!\\n\\nIn steps:\\n```\\n[ 2, 3, 5,45,45] becomes\\n[-3,-2, 0,40,40] that then becomes\\n[-2,-2, 0,39,40] that then becomes\\n[-1,-2, 0,39,39] that then becomes\\n[-1,-1, 0,38,39] that then becomes\\n[ 0,-1, 0,38,38] that then becomes\\n[ 0, 0, 0,37,38] that then finally becomes (adding the minimum again, as no value is no longer under the poverty threshold\\n[ 5, 5, 5,42,43]\\n```\\n\\nIf giving `minimum` is unfeasable with the current resources (as it often comes to be the case in socialist communities...), for example if the above starting population had set a goal of giving anyone at least `30`, just return an empty array `[]`.\\n\\nThe function should be called socialist_distribution and should pass all tests.

The board will always be square, so 5 means you will need a 5x5 board.\\n\\nThe dark squares will be represented by a unicode white square, while the light squares will be represented by a unicode black square (the opposite colours ensure the board doesn\\'t look reversed on code wars\\' dark background). It should return a string of the board with a space in between each square and taking into account new lines. \\n\\nAn even number should return a board that begins with a dark square. An odd number should return a board that begins with a light square.\\n\\nThe input is expected to be a whole number that\\'s at least two, and returns false otherwise (Nothing in Haskell).\\n\\nExamples:\\n\\n```python\\ncheckered_board(5)\\n```\\n\\nreturns the string\\n```\\n■ □ ■ □ ■\\n□ ■ □ ■ □\\n■ □ ■ □ ■\\n□ ■ □ ■ □\\n■ □ ■ □ ■\\n```\\n\\n**There should be no trailing white space at the end of each line, or new line characters at the end of the string.**\\n\\n**Note**   \\nDo not use HTML entities for the squares (e.g. `□` for white square) as the code doesn\\'t consider it a valid square. A good way to check is if your solution prints a correct checker board on your local terminal.  \\n\\n**Ruby note:**\\nCodeWars has encoding issues with rendered unicode in Ruby.\\nYou\\'ll need to use unicode source code (e.g. \"\\\\u25A0\") instead of rendered unicode (e.g \"■\").\\n\\nThe function should be called checkered_board and should pass all tests.

To save a you a lot of unnecessary (and boring) typing the keys and values for your amino acid dictionary are provided.\\n                         \\nGiven a string of RNA, create a funciton which translates the RNA into its protein sequence. Note: the test cases will always produce a valid string.\\n\\n```python\\nprotein('UGCGAUGAAUGGGCUCGCUCC') returns 'CDEWARS'\\n```\\n\\nIncluded as test cases is a real world example! The last example test case encodes for a protein called green fluorescent protein; once spliced into the genome of another organism, proteins like GFP allow biologists to visualize cellular processes!\\n\\nAmino Acid Dictionary\\n----------------------\\n\\n```python\\n    # Phenylalanine\\n    'UUC':'F', 'UUU':'F',\\n    # Leucine\\n    'UUA':'L', 'UUG':'L', 'CUU':'L', 'CUC':'L','CUA':'L','CUG':'L', \\n    # Isoleucine\\n    'AUU':'I', 'AUC':'I', 'AUA':'I', \\n    # Methionine\\n    'AUG':'M', \\n    # Valine\\n    'GUU':'V', 'GUC':'V', 'GUA':'V', 'GUG':'V', \\n    # Serine\\n    'UCU':'S', 'UCC':'S', 'UCA':'S', 'UCG':'S', 'AGU':'S', 'AGC':'S', \\n    # Proline\\n    'CCU':'P', 'CCC':'P', 'CCA':'P', 'CCG':'P', \\n    # Threonine\\n    'ACU':'T', 'ACC':'T', 'ACA':'T', 'ACG':'T',\\n    # Alanine\\n    'GCU':'A', 'GCC':'A', 'GCA':'A', 'GCG':'A', \\n    # Tyrosine\\n    'UAU':'Y', 'UAC':'Y', \\n    # Histidine\\n    'CAU':'H', 'CAC':'H',\\n    # Glutamine\\n    'CAA':'Q', 'CAG':'Q', \\n    # Asparagine\\n    'AAU':'N', 'AAC':'N', \\n    # Lysine\\n    'AAA':'K', 'AAG':'K',\\n    # Aspartic Acid\\n    'GAU':'D', 'GAC':'D', \\n    # Glutamic Acid\\n    'GAA':'E', 'GAG':'E',\\n    # Cystine\\n    'UGU':'C', 'UGC':'C',\\n    # Tryptophan\\n    'UGG':'W', \\n    # Arginine\\n    'CGU':'R', 'CGC':'R', 'CGA':'R', 'CGG':'R', 'AGA':'R', 'AGG':'R', \\n    # Glycine\\n    'GGU':'G',  'GGC':'G', 'GGA':'G', 'GGG':'G', \\n    # Stop codon\\n    'UAA':'Stop', 'UGA':'Stop', 'UAG':'Stop'\\n```\\n\\nThe function should be called protein and should pass all tests.
