{"question": "\nA state has recently enacted a statute requiring all prospective voters in state elections who wish to write-in a candidate to print the candidate's full name, and designate the office for which the candidate is running. The statute provides that such information must be written on the ballot in ink inan appropriate space. A write-in candidate is a German-American and is of the opinion that he needs a large turnout of German voters in order to win the election. As a result, his campaign manager decides to mail to every registered German voter a tear-off sticker, which bears the candidate's name and office for which he is running. Since many native German people are not proficient in reading and writing English, the campaign manager believes that many of the voters will have difficulty writing the candidate's name and office on the ballot. As a result, the campaign manager has mounted an extensive media campaign to inform voters on how to apply the stickers to the ballot. Five months prior to the election an election official notifies the candidate's campaign committee that the tear-off stickers do not comply with the state statute. In her letter, the official explains that state election officials are of the opinion that it is necessary for potential voters to write the candidate's name in ink. Therefore, she concludes that the stickers do not comply with statutory requirements. Three weeks later, the candidate filed suit in federal district court against state election officials, claiming that their interpretation of the state statute violates the U. S. Constitution. Which of the following sets forth the strongest constitutional argument the candidate could make against the interpretation of the statute by the state officials?\n(A) It unreasonably discriminates against non-English speaking voters in general.\n(B) It goes against the spirit of the Twenty-fourth Amendment by effectively imposing a \"literacy tax.\"\n(C) It unreasonably interferes with the exclusive federal election power as embodied in the Fifteenth Amendment.\n(D) It unreasonably limits the means by which a candidate can campaign, infringing on democratic practices.\n(E) It unreasonably discriminates against write-in candidates for public office.\n(F) It unreasonably discriminates against German voters who lack a proficiency in the English language.\n(G) It unreasonably restricts freedom of speech as guaranteed by the First Amendment.\n(H) It unreasonably interferes with the 1965 Voting Rights Act outlawing literacy tests.\n(I) It violates the Equal Protection Clause by treating write-in candidates differently.\n(J) It interferes with the right to vote as guaranteed by the Nineteenth Amendment.\n", "category": "law", "id": 868, "gt_answer": "E", "prompt": [{"content": "Please reason step by step and provide your final answer in \\boxed{}.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "\nA state has recently enacted a statute requiring all prospective voters in state elections who wish to write-in a candidate to print the candidate's full name, and designate the office for which the candidate is running.

Adjoining the lemon grove directly to the west was a 10-acre farm that was owned in fee simple by a farmer. There was a four-lane highway that adjoined the lemon grove directly to the east. The widower, by way of gift, executed a deed naming his daughter as grantee. The deed granted to the daughter and her heirs an antebellum mansion located near the southern edge of the lemon grove.

A few days later, the purchaser made a belated application and received approval, but the seller insisted on a rescission of the contract. Will the seller likely prevail in rescinding the transaction?\n(A) No, because the approval of the belated application should allow the transaction to proceed.\n(B) No, because the amount of time that he was late was a \"de minimus\" delay that should not preclude him from the benefit of the bargain.\n(C) Yes, because the purchaser did not make a timely application and lost the protection of the contingency clause.\n(D) Yes, because the purchaser did not fulfill the conditions of the contingency clause in the specified time.\n(E) No, because the original request to his mortgage broker friend was a timely application within the spirit of the agreement.\n(F) Yes, because the purchaser did not formally submit a mortgage application, violating the agreement.\n(G) Yes, because the seller has the right to rescind the sale at any time.\n(H) No, because the seller did not give the purchaser an opportunity to correct his mistake.\n(I) Yes, because she rescinded the sale prior to his notifying her of the approval \u0080\u0093 the first notice communicated is the effective one.\n(J) No, because the purchaser's discussion with a mortgage broker should be considered as an attempt to apply.\n", "role": "user"}], "fake_answer": "A"}

{"question": "\nAn environmentalist was very interested in environmental issues, particularly protection of wetland areas. He decided to dig out the lawn in his back yard and turn the space into a swampy marsh. Eventually, his back yard was filled with tall grasses, reeds, and other marsh plants.

{"question": "\nA woman was married to a very wealthy man who had a generous life insurance policy. Deciding that she had had enough of married life, and desiring to spend more time with her boyfriend, she began to plan an early and unexpected demise for her husband. The woman devised a scheme whereby she would contaminate her husband's guacamole with a poisonous substance called strychnine. To facilitate her plan, she enlisted the help of her boyfriend. At first, the boyfriend adamantly refused to go along with her scheme, but when the woman threatened to break off their relationship, he reluctantly agreed.

He tried to open the door, realized it was not locked, and went inside. In the cabin, he found some food to eat and some blankets that kept him warm through the night. By the next morning, the snow had stopped, and he was able to make his way out of the forest. If the owner of the cabin sues the hiker, seeking to recover damages for the cost of the food and for the use of his cabin, what is the most likely outcome of the case?\n(A) The hiker must pay for the cost of the food, the use of the cabin, and any damage caused.\n(B) The hiker does not owe anything because he was not aware of the cabin's ownership.\n(C) The hiker must pay for the cost of the food and a fine for trespassing.\n(D) The hiker must pay double the cost of the food as a penalty for unauthorized access.\n(E) The hiker must pay for the use of the cabin, but nothing else.\n(F) The hiker must pay for the cost of the food and an additional charge for the inconvenience.\n(G) The hiker must pay for the cost of the food, but nothing else.\n(H) The hiker does not owe anything because the importance of his survival outweighs the property interests of the cabin owner.\n(I) The hiker must pay for the cost of the food and the rental value of the cabin for one night.\n", "category": "law", "id": 1046, "gt_answer": "G", "prompt": [{"content": "Please reason step by step and provide your final answer in \\boxed{}.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "\nA hiker was enjoying a journey through a large forest when he was caught in an unexpected blizzard.

{"question": "\nTo improve the quality of rental housing within its boundaries, a city proposed an ordinance requiring all new and existing rental housing units to provide at least one full bathroom for each bedroom, plumbing and electrical hookups for a washer and dryer, and a covered parking space. A majority of the owners of existing rental housing in the city opposed the ordinance. They argued that it would dramatically decrease the number of lowincome rental housing units because owners would be unable to raise rents enough to recoup the investment required to comply. Without denying these contentions, the city enacted the ordinance. A plaintiff who owns low-income rental housing has sued the city, claiming only that the ordinance is unconstitutional on its face. Which of the following best states the burden of persuasion in this action?\n(A) The city must demonstrate that the ordinance is necessary to serve a compelling state interest, because it adversely affects the fundamental right of rental housing owners to use their property in the manner they deem most economically efficient.\n(B) The plaintiff must demonstrate that there is no rational relationship between the ordinance and any legitimate state interest, because the ordinance regulates economic activity of a type normally presumed to be within state regulatory authority.\n(C) The city must demonstrate that the ordinance does not violate the rights of the property owners, because it regulates the use of their property.\n(D) The plaintiff must demonstrate that the ordinance is not proportionate to the intended public benefit, because it imposes a financial burden on property owners.\n(E) The plaintiff must demonstrate that the ordinance is not substantially related to an important state interest, because it requires some owners of rental housing to invest money that they will not be able to recoup from increased rents.\n(F) The plaintiff must demonstrate that there is no substantial relationship between the ordinance and the city's goal of improving housing quality, because it may result in fewer low-income housing options.\n(G) The city must demonstrate that the ordinance is necessary to improve the standard of living within its jurisdiction, because it regulates housing conditions.\n(H) The city must demonstrate that the ordinance is necessary to serve a compelling state interest, because it will have a substantial and disproportionate negative impact on low-income persons.\n(I) The plaintiff must demonstrate that the ordinance does not serve a significant public interest, because it adversely affects low-income individuals.\n(J) The city must prove that the ordinance has a rational basis, because it impacts economic activity within its jurisdiction.\n", "category": "law", "id": 1083, "gt_answer": "B", "prompt": [{"content": "Please reason step by step and provide your final answer in \\boxed{}.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "\nTo improve the quality of rental housing within its boundaries, a city proposed an ordinance requiring all new and existing rental housing units to provide at least one full bathroom for each bedroom, plumbing and electrical hookups for a washer and dryer, and a covered parking space.

Sewage from parcel \"A\" drained through the system to a municipal sewer, which was located at the bottom of the mountain. In 2005, the man sold parcel \"B\" to his friend. The following year, the cousin purchased parcel \"C\" from the man. The deeds to the friend and the cousin did not contain any mention of the man's drainage system.

{"question": "\nA recent law school graduate took and passed the bar examination. Before the swearing-in ceremony, however, the graduate received a letter from the bar examiners indicating that his admission would be delayed until a character fitness investigation had been completed. The examiners also requested information as to whether the graduate had ever been arrested, convicted, or placed on probation for a criminal offense. The graduate had been arrested as a juvenile for possession of marijuana. He was placed in a special drug education program for first- time juvenile offenders and was told that the arrest would be expunged. Since the graduate believed that he had been totally exonerated of criminal liability, he didn't report the arrest on his bar application form. The bar examiners had, in fact, received an anonymous letter making reference to the graduate's juvenile arrest and suggesting that he was not morally fit to be admitted as an attorney. In addition, the letter provided detailed information about the facts related to the offense. As a result, the examiners hired a special investigator, to look into the matter. As part of the investigator's inquiry, he went to the clerk of the juvenile court where the offense occurred and demanded access to the records concerning the graduate. The clerk refused, citing a state statute that required all court and police records relating to juveniles be sealed. After all other attempts to gain access to the records proved futile, the bar examiners filed suit in federal district court demanding access to the relevant documents. The court should rule that, as applied to this case, the state statute regarding the sealing of juvenile records is\n(A) constitutional, because it safeguards the principle of rehabilitation by shielding individuals from their past juvenile offenses.\n(B) constitutional, because it protects the privacy rights of individuals who committed offenses as minors.\n(C) constitutional, because the state has a strong and legitimate interest in rehabilitating juvenile offenders, and this is furthered by protecting them from embarrassment in later life through revelation ofjuvenile offenses.\n(D) constitutional, because it promotes the principle of 'forgetting' past juvenile indiscretions to enable successful reintegration into society.\n(E) unconstitutional, because it infringes on the federal court's jurisdiction over bar admission matters.\n(F) unconstitutional, because it hinders the interests of justice by preventing the bar examiners from determining the fitness of candidates to practice law.\n(G) constitutional, because juveniles are entitled to the equal protection of the laws.\n(H) unconstitutional, because the bar examiners, as a quasi-judicial agency, is entitled to haveaccess to all relevant public documents.\n(I) unconstitutional, because it violates the right of the bar examiners to fully investigate the character of applicants.\n", "category": "law", "id": 1119, "gt_answer": "C", "prompt": [{"content": "Please reason step by step and provide your final answer in \\boxed{}.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "\nA recent law school graduate took and passed the bar examination.

{"question": "\nFor many years, persons engaged in real estate transactions in a state have utilized installment land contracts. The so-called installment land contract has been popular as a substitute for the mortgage or deed of trust. Under such a contract, the seller agrees to accept, and the buyer agrees to pay, the purchase price in installments over a stipulated period of time. The vendor retains legal title as security for the payment of the purchase price; and the vendee has equitable title under the doctrine of equitable conversion. The most important characteristic of the installment land contract, however, is the forfeiture clause, which provides that if the vendee is in default for 30 days, the vendor may, at his option, declare a forfeiture of the contract, in which case all payments made shall be forfeited as \"liquidated\" damages and the buyer shall become a tenant at will of the seller. Over the years, many sellers of property under such installment land contracts have declared forfeitures in situations where the prospective buyers were delinquent in their payments, even when the buyer was late with a single payment after nearly all the other payments had been made. In order to remedy this inequitable situation, the state legislature enacted a statute requiring any seller attempting to declare a forfeiture of an installment land contract to do so by instituting a formal foreclosure action in the courts. The new law also provided that prior to the commencement of such a foreclosure action, the seller under such an arrangement must give the buyer a 60-day grace period to make up any delinquent installment payment with interest. The new law expressly applied both to installment land contracts entered into subsequent to its enactment and to installment land contracts already in existence at the time of its enactment. Is this new state statute likely to be held constitutional?\n(A) No, because application of the law to installment land contracts entered into before or after its enactment is a deprivation of a proprietary interest without due process of the law.\n(B) No, because it changes the terms of contracts that have already been agreed upon and are in effect.\n(C) Yes, because it is a reasonable regulation of the procedure to be followed in such cases and does not substantially diminish the underlying obligations of the buyer.\n(D) Yes, because it balances the rights of both buyers and sellers in real estate transactions.\n(E) Yes, because it provides an additional protection for buyers in a vulnerable position.\n(F) No, because it infringes on the seller's right to manage their property as they see fit.\n(G) No, because it interferes with the agreed contractual terms between the buyer and seller.\n(H) No, because application of the law to installment land contracts entered into prior to its enactment is a violation of the obligation of contracts.\n(I) Yes, because the authority to enact laws regulating real estate sales transactions occurring within the boundaries of individual states is reserved exclusively to the states by the Tenth Amendment.\n(J) Yes, because it provides a remedy for an unfair situation and doesn't alter the basic contract obligations.\n", "category": "law", "id": 1129, "gt_answer": "C", "prompt": [{"content": "Please reason step by step and provide your final answer in \\boxed{}.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "\nFor many years, persons engaged in real estate transactions in a state have utilized installment land contracts.

The defendant and his friend decided to beat up the victim while he and the woman were on their camping trip.

{"question": "\nWhile undergoing a routine plastic surgery procedure, a patient died on the operating table. The patient's husband is suing the plastic surgeon alleging malpractice. Two years later, at trial, the defense called another doctor as an expert witness. The expert witness testified that the patient's death was a freak accident and that the surgeon's performance met the highest standards for medical care. On cross-examination, the plaintiff's attorney brings out the fact that, one week before trial, the expert witness and the surgeon signed an agreement to become partners in an outpatient plastic surgery clinic. The plaintiff's attorney suggests that the expert's testimony was awfully convenient and likely motivated by his desire to maintain a good relationship with the defendant. The defendant then calls another surgeon at the hospital as a witness. He is asked to tell the jury about a conversation he had with the expert inunediately following the patient's death.

The mother telephoned their family doctor, who instructed her to drive the father to the local hospital. The doctor indicated that he would meet them there. A short time later at the hospital, the doctor treated the father and bandaged his hand. However, due to the fact that the father had lost a considerable amount of blood, the doctor ordered an immediate blood transfusion. After determining that the father's blood type was A-positive, the doctor orally instructed a nurse, who was employed by the hospital, to obtain the necessary blood for the transfusion. The nurse followed the doctor's instructions and telephoned the hospital's blood bank department and ordered a unit of A-positive blood. The person in the blood bank who received the nurse's call correctly wrote down the order for A-positive blood. However, someone working at the blood bank, whose identity cannot be determined, made an error in filling the order and labeling the unit of blood for the father. As a result, the blood bank sent a unit of B-positive blood mislabeled as A-positive blood. After being administered the wrong blood, the father died. The hospital has a written rule in effect whereby all orders for blood transfusions must be made in writing by the physician in charge of the patient's treatment.

{"question": "\nA state in which several popular ski resorts are located has enacted a law requiring state certification of ski instructors. Under the law, applicants for certification must attend a monthlong course, pass a test, and pay a fee of $1,000. The stated purpose of the law is to \"promote uniformity in the methods of ski instruction at the state's ski areas.\" Shortly before the law's enactment, when the state did not require certification of ski instructors, a woman moved to the state intending to find employment as a ski instructor. The woman had been a ski instructor in another state for many years. But since her move, even though ski resorts in the state have found her to be highly qualified, no resort will offer her a contract for employment as a ski instructor because she has not received the required state certification. As applied to the woman, does the state certification requirement constitute a violation of the contracts clause?\n(A) Yes, because, as applied to an otherwise qualified ski instructor, the requirement is not rationally related to a legitimate government interest.\n(B) No, because the law is necessary for the safety of skiers.\n(C) Yes, because the requirement substantially impairs her ability to contract for employment in the absence of an important government objective.\n(D) No, because the law applies to all ski instructors equally.\n(E) Yes, because the certification requirement is too costly and time-consuming.\n(F) Yes, because the law was enacted after she moved to the state.\n(G) Yes, because the law restricts her freedom to engage in her profession.\n(H) No, because she has no existing contract that is being impaired.\n(I) No, because her ability to contract for employment with the state is not being impaired.\n(J) No, because the certification requirement is intended to standardize ski instruction.\n", "category": "law", "id": 1185, "gt_answer": "H", "prompt": [{"content": "Please reason step by step and provide your final answer in \\boxed{}.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "\nA state in which several popular ski resorts are located has enacted a law requiring state certification of ski instructors.

{"question": "\nA developer wished to build an apartment house in a local city. He raised $1 million from various sources to fund the project. After searching for a vacant lot that would be sufficient for development, the developer concluded that there was not a suitable vacant lot available. Reluctantly, the developer concluded that he would have to purchase a developed lot, have the existing structures removed, and then build the apartment house. The developer was reluctant to do this, because he had not budgeted for the additional cost of buying a developed property and removing the development. After a search for an appropriate parcel, the developer purchased a large lot, developed with a single-story residential home, for $200,000. He then spent $50,000 having the residential home removed from the lot. Knowing that it would cost approximately $850,000 to build the apartment house, the developer realized he would need to raise another $100,000. He approached an investor about lending him $100,000. The investor was apprehensive about the project because the developer had not yet lined up a construction firm to build the apartment house. As a result, the parties signed the following written agreement:\"The investor promises to lend to the developer $100,000 at 5 percent interest within 30 days, provided the developer contracts with a construction company to build the apartment house for no more than $850,000.

{"question": "\nAfter graduating from law school, a graduate moved to a city where she had been offered a position in an entertainment law firm. When she arrived, the graduate was told that her job was contingent on passing the state bar examination, which was being offered in July. In preparing for the bar examination, the graduate planned to take a bar review course. Although she had not pre-enrolled, the graduate planned to attend and pay for the course at registration. On the morning the course was set to begin, the graduate arrived late after getting stuck in freeway traffic. By the time the graduate got to the course location, registration had already been completed. When the graduate looked into the room where the course was being conducted, she saw the lecture had begun, and everyone was inside busily taking notes. Panicky, the graduate picked up a set of course materials that were lying on the registration table and entered without paying. Although the graduate intended to pay the enrollment fee, no one was at the registration table to take her money. After attending the first couple of classes, the graduate sent a cashier's check for the full amount of the enrollment fee to the bar review company. Unbeknownst to the graduate, the bar review course's regional director noticed that she had entered the lectures without paying. After ascertaining her identity from a fellow student who knew the graduate, the company filed a complaint with the local prosecutor, and a warrant was issued for her arrest. The complaint charged the graduate with the crime of larceny by trick, for deliberately failing to pay for services rendered. After the complaint was issued, the graduate's check arrived at the company's office. The company deposited the check but failed to inform the prosecutor that payment had been received. The graduate was arrested and held in custody overnight before the matter was resolved. The graduate suffered severe emotional distress at the publicity she received in the local newspapers and the humiliation she suffered for being arrested and held in police custody.

A grocery store owner purchased discounted food stamps from an undercover agent, and was arrested for violating the statute.

{"question": "\nA taxicab driver stopped at a convenience store to buy a snack. While he was handing his money to the store clerk at the cash register, a police officer entered the store. The taxi driver had received several traffic tickets from the police officer, and he felt that the police officer had been very rude to him. Seeking to gain some revenge, the taxi driver immediately began to taunt and berate the police officer, calling him a variety of profane and insulting names. The police officer was going through a series of personal difficulties and was feeling very emotionally fragile. As the taxi driver's insults rained down on him, the police officer suddenly snapped. He whipped out his gun and fired a shot at the taxi driver. The bullet missed the taxi driver but hit the store clerk, who was standing behind the taxi driver. The clerk survived the shooting but suffered a gunshot wound to his shoulder. In an action by the injured clerk against the taxi driver to recover for his personal injuries, plaintiff will most likely\n(A) recover, because the taxi driver indirectly caused the police officer to react violently.\n(B) not recover, because the police officer intended to shoot the taxi driver, not the store clerk.\n(C) not recover, because the taxi driver had no control over the police officer's actions.\n(D) not recover, because the police officer was the one who fired the gun.\n(E) recover, because the taxi driver should have known his actions could provoke the police officer.\n(F) not recover, because the taxi driver didn't physically harm the clerk.\n(G) recover, because the taxi driver's actions were reckless and endangered everyone in the store.\n(H) not recover, because the shooting was not a foreseeable consequence of the taxi driver's conduct.\n(I) recover, because it was foreseeable that the taxi driver's conduct would result in the clerk being shot.\n(J) recover, because the taxi driver's conduct was the proximate cause of the clerk's injuries.\n", "category": "law", "id": 1332, "gt_answer": "H", "prompt": [{"content": "Please reason step by step and provide your final answer in \\boxed{}.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "\nA taxicab driver stopped at a convenience store to buy a snack.

Knowing that his parents were giving a dinner party that evening, the boy filled a bucket with ice-cold water and balanced it on the partially open door of the guest bedroom, thinking that his father would take the guests' coats there to put them on the bed.

{"question": "\nA defendant was convicted of assault of a federal officer and imprisoned in a federal penitentiary. While in prison, federal authorities began investigating the murder of the defendant's 11-year- old stepdaughter who was murdered two years earlier. Believing that the defendant was responsible for this killing, federal agents decided to plant an informant at the prison to befriend the defendant and possibly obtain evidence about the crime. In accord with this plan, the federal agents hired a paid informant and placed him in the prison as a fellow inmate, masquerading as an organized crime figure. The informant soon befriended the defendant and learned that he was being threatened by other inmates because of a rumor that he had killed a child. The informant then raised the subject in several conversations, but the defendant repeatedly denied any such involvement. After the defendant started receiving tough treatment from other inmates because of the rumor, the informant offered to protect the defendant but told him, \"You have to tell me the truth about what really happened you know, if you want me to help you. \" Believing that the informant would protect him from the other inmates, the defendant then admitted to the informant that he had driven his stepdaughter to the desert where he killed her. Based upon this confession, the defendant was then indicted for the first-degree murder of his stepdaughter. Prior to trial, the defendant moves to suppress the statement given to the informant. Should the defendant's motion be granted?\n(A) No, because the confession was made to a fellow inmate, not to a law enforcement official.\n(B) Yes, because the confession was coerced by the threat of physical violence, absent protection from the informant that motivated the defendant to confess.\n(C) No, because the defendant was not under direct questioning by law enforcement at the time of the confession.\n(D) Yes, because the informant was acting as an agent of the government in a deceptive manner.\n(E) Yes, because the informant was a false friend, and the defendant was tricked into making the confession.\n(F) Yes, because the defendant was not read his Miranda rights before confessing to the informant.\n(G) No, because the defendant was already convicted of a crime and thus lost his right to avoid self-incrimination.\n(H) No, because under the totality of circumstances, the informant's conduct was not inherently coercive.\n(I) No, because the confession was voluntary.\n(J) No, because the defendant's safety in prison was not the responsibility of the informant.\n", "category": "law", "id": 1389, "gt_answer": "B", "prompt": [{"content": "Please reason step by step and provide your final answer in \\boxed{}.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "\nA defendant was convicted of assault of a federal officer and imprisoned in a federal penitentiary.

{"question": "\nA doctor who was licensed to practice medicine in a particular state was convicted in state court of improperly distributing specified drugs by writing prescriptions for fictitious persons. Under state law, such an abuse of the prescription-writing privilege requires revocation of a doctor's license. After it received an official notification of the doctor's conviction, the state medical board revoked the doctor's license without affording the doctor any opportunity for a hearing. The doctor has sued the board in state court to set aside the revocation, alleging deprivation of property without due process of law because the board did not provide an opportunity for a trial-type hearing before revoking the license. The doctor does not deny the conviction or the factual basis for it. Which of the following is the strongest argument in support of the state medical board?\n(A) The licensing board was required to summarily revoke the doctor's license because Article IV, Section 1, of the Constitution requires the licensing board to give full faith and credit to the doctor's criminal conviction.\n(B) A doctor's license to practice is a privilege, not a right, and therefore is not property within the meaning of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n(C) The board's decision to revoke the doctor's license without a hearing is justified because of the severe nature of the doctor's crime.\n(D) The doctor's admission of the conviction and its factual basis eliminates the need for a hearing before the board.\n(E) The medical board has an obligation to protect the public from doctors who abuse their prescription-writing privileges, and a hearing would delay necessary action.\n(F) The doctor's conviction in state court is enough evidence of his guilt, and a hearing before the board would be redundant and unnecessary.\n(G) The adjudicative facts necessary to revoke the doctor's license were determined in the criminal trial, and therefore due process does not require any further trial-type hearing.\n(H) The doctor has already had a fair trial in a court of law, and the board's hearing would not change the outcome of that trial.\n(I) The medical board was merely following state law, which requires revocation of a doctor's license in such cases.\n(J) Due process requires a balancing of interests, and the state's interest in preventing drug abuse outweighs the doctor's interest in the particular procedure followed in the disciplinary proceeding.\n", "category": "law", "id": 1395, "gt_answer": "G", "prompt": [{"content": "Please reason step by step and provide your final answer in \\boxed{}.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "\nA doctor who was licensed to practice medicine in a particular state was convicted in state court of improperly distributing specified drugs by writing prescriptions for fictitious persons.

{"question": "\nA woman was employed as a state trooper. Although the state provides both sexes with equal pay and benefits, the state has adopted a policy that prohibits the assignment of female officers to its special undercover narcotics division. This is a moderate risk position that sometimes involves violent encounters with drug dealers. Since the special narcotics division was first established, five undercover agents have been killed in the line of duty. It is because of the state's concern with the safety and well-being of its female officers that it has adopted such a policy. The woman, who desired to be a member of the narcotics division, filed an application for assignment as a special drug agent. After she was rejected for the position, the woman sued the state in federal court to enjoin enforcement of its stated policy on the grounds that it is unconstitutional. As a matter of constitutional law, which of the following results in this suit is most appropriate?\n(A) Judgment for the state, because the state has articulated a rational basis for this classification and, therefore, a court may not substitute its judgment for that of responsible state officials.\n(B) Judgment for the woman, because the state's policy is not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest.\n(C) Judgment for the state, because the dangerous nature of the work in the narcotics division provides a valid basis for the policy.\n(D) Judgment for the state, because it is within a state's police power to insulate the terms and conditions of governmental employment.\n(E) Judgment for the state, because the nature of the position justifies a gender-based classification.\n(F) Judgment for the state, because the state has a compelling interest in protecting the safety of its employees.\n(G) Judgment for the woman, because gender-based discrimination in state employment violates the Equal Protection Clause.\n(H) Judgment for the woman, because the facts asserted do not demonstrate that the particular classification contained in this policy is substantially related to the advancement of an important state interest.\n(I) Judgment for the woman, because the terms and conditions of state government employment are privileges or immunities of state citizenship that may not be abridged by the state on the basis of gender.\n(J) Judgment for the woman, because the state's policy constitutes unjustified sex discrimination.\n", "category": "law", "id": 1415, "gt_answer": "H", "prompt": [{"content": "Please reason step by step and provide your final answer in \\boxed{}.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "\nA woman was employed as a state trooper.

{"question": "\nA man borrowed $150,000 from a bank to remodel his home and executed a promissory note agreeing to repay the loan over a 10-year period. The loan was secured by a mortgage on the home. The bank promptly recorded the mortgage, which was the only lien on the home at that time. Several months later, the man borrowed $40,000 from his mother in order to purchase a new truck and gave his mother a mortgage on the home to secure repayment of the debt. The mother promptly recorded the mortgage. The man later lost his job and was struggling to make loan payments to both the bank and his mother. To accommodate the man's financial situation, the bank extended the amortization period of its loan to substantially reduce the amount of each monthly payment. The bank did not alter the interest rate or increase the principal amount of the loan. At the time of the modification of the bank loan, the man was not in default in his payments to his mother. Neither the bank nor the man informed the mother of the modification of the bank loan. After the man later missed five payments to his mother, she commenced a foreclosure action. While the action was pending, the mother learned of the bank's loan modification.

In order to comply with state highway regulations, the state highway department, acting pursuant to state statute, ordered the city to prohibit parking on one side of the highway within the business district. The city council convened a special meeting to determine whether parking should be prohibited on the east or west side of the street. During the meeting, the council was unable to resolve the issue. Finally, the city council president decided the only fair way to resolve the matter was to flip a coin. After the coin flip, the city prohibited parking at all times on the west side of the highway. On account of this decision, parking in front of the lounge was permanently prohibited. This caused the lounge to suffer a substantial decline in business because of the unavailability of on-street parking.

The boy thought the card had very little value because he knew that Rickey was not a major league baseball player. The boy accepted the 50 cents and gave the Rickey baseball card to the collector. The next day the boy found out that the baseball card was worth$600. If the boy asserts a claim against the collector for deceit, will the boy prevail?\n(A) No, because the boy had the opportunity to decline the collector's offer.\n(B) Yes, because the collector took advantage of the boy's lack of knowledge about the card's value.\n(C) Yes, because the collector was obligated to disclose the true value of the card.\n(D) No, because the boy was not justified in relying on the collector's offer.\n(E) Yes, because the collector used his knowledge of the card's value to exploit the boy.\n(F) No, because the boy willingly accepted the offer made by the collector.\n(G) Yes, because the boy was the true owner of the card and was entitled to the benefit of the bargain.\n(H) Yes, because the collector did not disclose the true value of the card.\n(I) No, because the collector didn't force the boy to sell the card.\n(J) No, because the collector made no false representations of fact.\n", "role": "user"}], "fake_answer": "F"}

As he was coming in for an emergency landing, the plane crossed into a neighboring state at a very low altitude. At this time, a 9-year-old boy was walking to school when he was struck and injured by an object, which may have fallen from the plane.

{"question": "\nTwo co-defendants were investment brokers at a bank. They had been employed by the bank for ten years. One day, they were unexpectedly fired by the bank's new manager. Apparently, the co-defendants' investments had not been performing well in the economic downturn. The co-defendants, upset and humiliated by their firing, vowed to get back at the bank. As their revenge, they decided to plant a bomb in the bank and demand $2,000,000. After receiving the money, they would then reveal the location of the bomb and provide details for defusing it. The co-defendants agreed that the bank should be given adequate warning so that nobody would be injured. In accordance with their plan, the co-defendants consulted the Internet, where they found all the information they needed on how to build a bomb. They built the bomb and placed it in a supply closet. Shortly thereafter, they phoned the bank and made a demand for the money. They said a bomb was in the bank and that it would explode in 24 hours unless the money was paid. The bank refused to pay the money. Realizing that their plan had gone awry, they drove to the bank to attempt to defuse the bomb.

The plats and each deed provided that \"the use of the land herein conveyed is restricted to single- family dwellings only, and this covenant is intended to apply to each and every lot in the subdivision and runs with the land, binding every lot owner, his heirs, and assigns. \"After all but four lots in each subdivision had been sold by the land development company, it sold 50 acres of the remaining 100 acres of land to a country club by a deed containing the following provisions:\"This deed is executed and accepted with the understanding that the property above described is hereby restricted so that(1) said property may be used as a country club, with a golf course, pool, tennis courts, club house, eating facilities, and other improvements appropriate to a country club. (2) said property may also be subdivided and platted as a residential subdivision similar to the eastern development and the property shall thereafter be used in accordance with and conveyed subject to residential restrictions that shall conform with those restrictions in force against the eastern development. (3) the restrictions herein contained shall be deemed covenants running with the land, and for breach of any covenant herein, grantor \u0080\u0094 land development company, its successors and assigns may, at its option, re-enter and terminate the estate conveyed hereby. \"At the time of this conveyance, the land development company retained title to the remaining 50 acres in the original 400-acre tract. Which of the following would best describe the country club's interest in the SO-acre tract that it purchased from the land development company?\n(A) Easement appurtenant.\n(B) Determinable fee subject to an executory interest.\n(C) Fee simple subject to condition subsequent.\n(D) Life estate pur autre vie.\n(E) Leasehold estate.\n(F) Remainder interest.\n(G) Fee simple absolute.\n(H) Fee simple subject to executory limitation.\n(I) Fee simple determinable.\n(J) Fee simple defeasible.\n", "role": "user"}], "fake_answer": "D"}

{"question": "\nAfter watching a television program about archery, a 15-year-old boy became very interested in that sport. He saved up some money to buy a bow and other archery equipment. He set up a target in his backyard in order to practice. He surrounded the target with stacks of hay bales to stop any arrows that missed the target. After practicing for a few weeks, the boy made great improvements in his technique and accuracy. While practicing one afternoon, however, the boy lost his balance just as he released an arrow. As a result, the arrow flew way off course, going over the target and all the hay bales and flying into a wooded area behind the boy's house. The boy assumed no one was in the woods, so he was relieved that the errant arrow would not hurt anyone. However, a hiker happened to be in the woods near the boy's house. As he paused for a moment to take a drink of water, the hiker suddenly saw something out of the corner of his eye. It was the stray arrow shot by the boy. Without even thinking about it, the hiker reflexively ducked out of the way. The arrow narrowly missed the hiker's head; but as the hiker ducked out of the way, his head struck the limb of a tree, causing a stick to stab painfully into his eye.

{"question": "\nA woman had spent many years converting her back yard to an authentic Japanese-style garden. Her garden had become a showplace for the neighborhood, and various civic groups and organizations frequently visited the woman's property to enjoy the beauty of the yard. Recently, the woman had read about a particular cymbidium that was native to Japan. Desiring to have one of these cymbidiums planted in her garden, she contacted a number of plant distributors, only to discover that this particular cymbidium had not yet been imported to the United States. She contacted a plant distributor, who she knew had ties to Japan, and asked if it would be possible to acquire one of these cymbidiums from Japan. After checking with local and Japanese authorities, the distributor determined that he could indeed acquire the plant for the woman. The parties then signed a contract that stated the distributor would acquire the cymbidium from a nursery in Japan, have it shipped to the United States and have it planted in the woman's garden for the price of $5,000. The distributor promised that the plant would be in place within six months, and the woman promised to pay $1,000 at the time of the execution of the contract and$4,000 when the cymbidium was planted in her garden. The woman then handed a check for $1,000 to the distributor. Two weeks later, agricultural officials discovered that a special type of beetle that attacked citrus plants had adapted to using cymbidiums for nesting purposes. The female beetle would lay eggs among the roots of the cymbidiums, and it would sometimes take up to one year for the eggs to hatch. Fearing for the safety of the citrus crops in the United States, the United States government adopted a ban on the importation of all cymbidiums grown in foreign countries. As a result, the distributor was not able to acquire the cymbidium for the woman. Which of the following best states the legal relationship at this point between the distributor the woman?\n(A) The distributor's performance was not excused because of impossibility, and the woman can recover damages.\n(B) The distributor's performance was excused because of the supervening illegality, but the woman can seek restitution.\n(C) Both parties are excused from performance because of the supervening illegality, and neither can recover from the other.\n(D) Both parties are not excused from performance because of the supervening illegality, and either can recover from the other.\n(E) The distributor's performance was not excused because of the supervening illegality, and the woman can recover damages, provided she waits until the date performance was due before filing suit.\n(F) The distributor's performance was excused because of impossibility, but the woman can seek restitution.\n(G) The distributor's performance was not excused because of the supervening illegality, and the woman can recover damages because of the distributor's prospective inability to perform.\n(H) Both parties are excused from performance because of the impossibility, and neither can recover from the other.\n(I) The distributor's performance was excused because of impossibility, and the woman cannot seek restitution.\n", "category": "law", "id": 1636, "gt_answer": "F", "prompt": [{"content": "Please reason step by step and provide your final answer in \\boxed{}.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "\nA woman had spent many years converting her back yard to an authentic Japanese-style garden.

{"question": "\nPolice were conducting a house-to-house search for an escaped convict. During the search, a police officer went to a home and rang the doorbell. When a teenage male opened the door, the police officer told him that a convict had escaped and asked if he had seen anyone suspicious in the neighborhood. The teenager said he hadn't but then asked the police officer to come inside to ensure the house was safe. The police officer entered the home and proceeded to look around. When he went into the kitchen, the police officer noticed a bag containing white powder on the counter. Suspecting that the bag contained narcotics, the police officer questioned the teenager as to its contents. The teenager said he didn't live in the house and had never seen it before. The police officer confiscated the bag and took the teenager to the station house for questioning, at which time it was determined that the teenager had escaped from a psychiatric hospital and had broken into the home earlier in the day. Furthermore, the results of a police lab test found that the bag contained heroin. As a result, the police issued an arrest warrant for the owner of the home. He was apprehended and charged with possession of heroin. The homeowner's attorney has filed a motion to suppress, claiming that the heroin confiscated by the police was unlawfully obtained. The motion should be\n(A) denied, because the police officer was invited into the home by the teenager.\n(B) granted, because the homeowner was not present during the search.\n(C) granted, because the police officer did not have probable cause to search the house.\n(D) denied, because the teenager gave consent for the police officer to enter and search the home.\n(E) granted, because the teenager did not have an ownership or shared occupancy interest in the premises.\n(F) denied, because the police officer suspected that the bag contained narcotics.\n(G) granted, because the teenager did not have the authority to consent to a search of the house.\n(H) denied, because the police officer reasonably believed that he had permission to enter the dwelling.\n(I) denied, because the police officer reasonably believed that he had permission to enter the dwelling and reasonably believed that the teenager was competent to give consent.\n(J) granted, because the police officer did not have a warrant to search the house.\n", "category": "law", "id": 1654, "gt_answer": "G", "prompt": [{"content": "Please reason step by step and provide your final answer in \\boxed{}.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "\nPolice were conducting a house-to-house search for an escaped convict.

{"question": "\nAn appliance store was using part of a public alley to unload its trucks. There were no warning signs keeping pedestrians out or warning of unloading trucks.

{"question": "\nA riot broke out in a city, and many shops had been looted and some had been burned during the riots. Goods of all kinds were in piles or strewn about the sidewalk. During the riot, a defendant was walking along the street when he paused in front of an appliance store.

A police officer who was standing in front of the shop rushed after the defendant and arrested him. The defendant, an indigent, was charged with grand larceny, a felony carrying the maximum penalty of seven months imprisonment and a S 1,000 fine. At his arraignment, the judge advised the defendant of his right to have counsel appointed for him.

{"question": "\nA circus operates in a rural part of the county. It is the circus's practice to finish each day's entertainment by discharging a so-called aerial bomb into the sky. After exploding, the aerial bomb emits a spectacular rainbow fireworks display that is seen for miles around. One afternoon, a 10-year-old boy and a few friends went to the fairgrounds to see the circus. After paying their admission, they were about to enter the \"big top\" when the boy came upon an aerial bomb lying on the ground. Ignorant of what the object really was, but in an exploratory mood, the boy applied a match to the fuse of the fireworks device. It exploded and seriously injured the boy. After the accident, and before the parents of the boy had retained a lawyer, the adjuster for the circus's insurance carrier contacted the parents several times, trying to negotiate a settlement of their claim against the circus. On each occasion, the adjuster told the parents there was no need for them to hire an attorney because the applicable civil code did not provide for recovery in such a situation. The adjuster was aware that this information was blatantly false. He also warned the parents that unless they accepted his offered settlement of $5,000, they would receive nothing. For over a month, the adjuster continued to harass the parents. Outraged by the adjuster's actions, the parents sought the advice of a neighbor who recommended that they consult an attorney. The parents went ahead and retained a lawyer who subsequently negotiated a $250,000 settlement with the adjuster's insurance company for the claims relating to the boy's injury from the aerial bomb.

The architect made no reply and failed to perform the repainting as the lease required. The cost of repainting the tenant's office was estimated at $1,750. On July 1, 2008, the architect had still not repainted the premises. The following day, the tenant moved out, mailed the keys to the architect, and refused to pay any more rent. The lease was silent as to the rights and remedies of the tenant due to the architect's failure to perform the repainting. There is no applicable statute in the jurisdiction. In an appropriate action by the architect against the tenant for the rent due, the architect will\n(A) win, because there was no constructive eviction.\n(B) win, because the tenant did not take legal action against the architect for failure to repaint\n(C) lose, because the tenant has the right to withhold rent until the repainting is done\n(D) win, because the cost of repainting is less than the rent due\n(E) n, because the tenant had the remedy of self-help.\n(F) win, because the tenant left the premises before the lease term was over\n(G) lose, because the tenant was justified in leaving due to the architect's neglect of his duties.\n(H) lose, because he cannot maintain an action for rent while in breach of an express covenant.\n(I) lose, because the obligation to pay rent is dependent on the architect's performance of his express covenant.\n", "role": "user"}], "fake_answer": "B"}

{"question": "\nA home security protection company provided protection services to property owners in the immediate area. The owner of a summer cottage in the area hired the company to provide 24- hour protection during the winter months when his home was unoccupied. According to the security arrangement, the company's uniformed guards would periodically patrol the property and, if necessary, provide an \"armed response\" to any unauthorized individuals who were found trespassing on the property. The company provided security protection to the owner's property for two years. The owner then notified the company that he was planning to sell the cottage. As a result, he requested that the company discontinue its home-protection service, effective immediately. Two weeks later, a burglar broke into the cottage and was ransacking it. As the burglar was exiting from the owner's house carrying a portable television set, he was seen by a security guard working for the company.

The security guard suddenly stopped his patrol vehicle and ran toward the burglar shouting, \"Stop! Don't move or I'll shoot!\" Startled, the burglar dropped the television set and began to flee.

{"question": "\nA vacationer, on a winter ski holiday, visited a ski lift in a private park. The ski lift company had installed and operated the lift pursuant to a concession agreement with the owner of the private park. Visitors gained entry to the park on payment of a $5 fee, which entitled them to go ice skating, tobogganing, or sledding. A ski lift ticket cost an additional $7 per day. At the top of the ski lift, there was a platform for embarking and disembarking passengers. The ski lift company paid the owner a stipulated rental plus 15 percent of the net proceeds from the lift. Two employees of the company operated the lift, one from a station at the bottom and the other from a station at the top of the hill. When the vacationer boarded the ski lift, it was late afternoon and most of the skiers had left. He was the sole passenger on the lift. Meanwhile, the employee at the top had left his post to go to the bathroom, asking his friend to keep watch on the lift and to stop it to allow any passengers to disembark. The friend consented, and the employee showed him how to use the control switch. When the vacationer approached the top, the employee was still away. Instead of stopping the lift to permit the vacationer to get off, the friend allowed the lift to keep moving. The vacationer was carried past the platform, and he was swung violently from side to side as the ski lift started downward.

{"question": "\nA permanent resident alien applied for a position as a state trooper. A state trooper is a member of the state police force, a law enforcement body that exercises broad police authority throughout the state. The position of state trooper is filled on the basis of competitive examinations taken by all of the applicants. After the resident alien applied for the position, the state authorities refused him permission to take the qualifying examination. The state authorities based their refusal on state statute, which provided:\"No person shall become a member of the state police unless he/she shall be a citizen of the United States. \"Thus, under this provision, as a prerequisite to becoming a member of the state police, an alien must relinquish his foreign citizenship and become a citizen. In an opinion upholding the validity of the statute, the State Attorney General noted that since police officers fall within the category of important non-elective officials who participate directly in the execution of broad public policy, only citizens of the United States should be qualified to apply for such positions. \"At the time the resident alien applied for a position as a state trooper, he was a citizen of a foreign country and not currently eligible for citizenship. As a result of a federal statute, Congress has imposed a five-year residency requirement for the attainment of citizenship.

{"question": "\nOn Thursday morning, two plainclothes police officers were shot to death while trying to arrest a bank robber who had just robbed a bank. Following the killings, the police issued an \"all-points-bulletin\" for the arrest of a 40-year-old Caucasian male (height, 6 feet; weight, 150-155 pounds), who had been seen near the location of the bank robbery. On Friday, a security guard at a local department store was walking down Main Street when he noticed a tall, African American man who fit the bank robbery suspect's description in age, height, and weight. The security guard approached the person (and believing him to be the bank robbery suspect), pulled a gun and arrested him.

{"question": "\nA nightclub owner applied for a required zoning permit to open a nude-dancing nightclub in the theater district of a city.
