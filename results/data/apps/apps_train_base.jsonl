{"question":"PROBLEM:\n# A History Lesson\n\nTetris is a puzzle video game originally designed and programmed by Soviet Russian software engineer Alexey Pajitnov. The first playable version was completed on June 6, 1984. Pajitnov derived its name from combining the Greek numerical prefix tetra- (the falling pieces contain 4 segments) and tennis, Pajitnov's favorite sport.\n\n# About scoring system\n\nThe scoring formula is built on the idea that more difficult line clears should be awarded more points.

{"question":"PROBLEM:\n## Welcome to my (amazing) kata!\n\nYou are given a gigantic number to decode.  Each number is a code that alternates in a pattern between encoded text and a smaller, encoded number.  The pattern's length varies with every test, but the alternation between encoded text and an encoded number will always be there.  Following this rule, each number tested begins with encoded text and ends with an encoded number.\n\n## How the encoding works\n\nNow, we should probably review how the string of numbers is formed - considering you have to unform it. So, first, some text is taken, and encoded.  The system of encoding is taking each letter's position in the alphabet and adding 100 to it.  For example, `m` in the real text would be `113` in the code-number.\n\nAfter the text, there is a binary number.  You should convert this number to a normal, base 10 decimal (all of them can be converted into whole, non-negative numbers).\n\nSeparating encoded text and encoded numbers, there is a `98`.  Because the numbers are in binary, the only digits they use are '0' and '1', and each letter of the alphabet, encoded, is between 101-127, all instances of `98` are to indicate a separation between encoded text and encoded numbers.  There may also be a `98` at the very end of the number.\n\nWhen you return your final answer, the text and numbers should always be separated by a comma (`,`)\n\n## Example\n\n```python\ndecode(103115104105123101118119981001098113113113981000) = \"codewars, 18, mmm, 8\"\n```\nThe part of the code until the first `98` can be decoded to `\"codewars\"`.  `10010` is binary for `18`. `113113113` translates to `\"mmm\"`.

{"question":"PROBLEM:\nCascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language. A style sheet consists of a list of rules. Each rule or rule-set consists of one or more selectors, and a declaration block. Selector describes which element it matches.\n\nSometimes element is matched to multiple selectors. In this case, element inherits multiple styles, from each rule it matches. Rules can override each other. To solve this problem, each selector has it's own 'specificity' - e.g. weight. The selector with greater specificity overrides the other selector.\n\nYour task is to calculate the weights of two selectors and determine which of them will beat the other one.\n\n```python\ncompare(\"body p\", \"div\") # returns \"body p\"\ncompare(\".class\", \"#id\") # returns \"#id\"\ncompare(\"div.big\", \".small\") # returns \"div.big\"\ncompare(\".big\", \".small\") # returns \".small\" (because it appears later)\n```\n\nFor simplicity, all selectors in test cases are CSS1-compatible, test cases don't include pseudoclasses, pseudoelements, attribute selectors, etc. Below is an explanation on how to weight two selectors. You can read more about specificity here.\n\nThe simplest selector type is ``tagname`` selector. It writes as a simple  alphanumeric identifier: eg ``body``, ``div``, ``h1``, etc. It has the least weight. If selectors have multiple elements - the selector with more elements win. For example, ``body p`` beats ``div``, because it refers to 2 (nested) elements rather than 1.\n\nAnother simple selector is ``.class`` selector. It begins with dot and refer to element with specific ``class`` attribute. Class selectors can also be applied to tagname selectors, so ``div.red`` refer to ```` element. They can be grouped, for example, ``.red.striped``. Class selector beats tagname selector.\n\nThe most weighted selector type in stylesheet is ``#id`` selector. It begins with hash sign and refer to element with specific ``id`` attribute. It can also be standalone, or applied to an element.

{"question":"PROBLEM:\nConsider a sequence generation that follows the following steps. We will store removed values in variable `res`.

{"question":"PROBLEM:\nBinary with 0 and 1 is good, but binary with only 0 is even better! Originally, this is a concept designed by Chuck Norris to send so called unary messages.\n\nCan you write a program that can send and receive this messages?\n\nRules\n\nThe input message consists of ASCII characters between 32 and 127 (7-bit)\nThe encoded output message consists of blocks of 0\nA block is separated from another block by a space\nTwo consecutive blocks are used to produce a series of same value bits (only 1 or 0 values):\n\nFirst block is always 0 or 00. If it is 0, then the series contains 1, if not, it contains 0\nThe number of 0 in the second block is the number of bits in the series\n\n\nExample\nLet\u2019s take a simple example with a message which consists of only one character (Letter 'C').'C' in binary is represented as 1000011, so with Chuck Norris\u2019 technique this gives:\n\n0 0 - the first series consists of only a single 1\n00 0000 - the second series consists of four 0\n0 00 - the third consists of two 1\n\nSo 'C' is coded as: 0 0 00 0000 0 00\nSecond example, we want to encode the message \"CC\" (i.e. the 14 bits 10000111000011) :\n\n0 0 - one single 1\n00 0000 - four 0\n0 000 - three 1\n00 0000 - four 0\n0 00 - two 1\n\nSo \"CC\" is coded as: 0 0 00 0000 0 000 00 0000 0 00\nNote of thanks\nThanks to the author of the original kata.

For example, the array of integers [1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12] is the major scale of  1.\nSecondly, the pitch class of a note will be the set of all integers some multiple of 12 above or below the note.

An array is in the key of an integer if all its elements are in the key of the integer.\n\nYour job is to create a function is_tune that will return whether or not an array (or list) of integers is a tune. An array will be considered a tune if there exists a single integer note all the integers in the array are in the key of. The function will accept an array of integers as its parameter and return True if the array is a tune or False otherwise. Empty and null arrays are not considered to be tunes. Additionally, the function should not change the input array.\n Examples \n\n```python\nis_tune([1, 3, 6, 8, 10, 12]) # Returns True, all the elements are in the major scale  \n    # of 1 ([1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12]) and so are in the key of 1.\nis_tune([1, 3, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13, 15]) # Returns True, 14 and 15 are also in the key of 1 as \n    # they are in the major scale of 13 which is in the pitch class of 1 (13 = 1 + 12 * 1).\nis_tune([1, 6, 3]) # Returns True, arrays don't need to be sorted.\nis_tune([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]) # Returns False, this array is not in the \n    # key of any integer.\nis_tune([2, 4, 7, 9, 11, 13]) # Returns True, the array is in the key of 2 (the arrays\n    #  don't need to be in the key of 1, just some integer)\n```\n\nThe function should be called is_tune and should pass all tests. Use the following starter code:\n```python\n\ndef is_tune(notes):\n\t\n```\n\nSOLUTION:\n","role":"user"}],"gt_answer":["assert is_tune([[1, 3, 6, 8, 10, 12]]) == [True]","assert is_tune([[1, 3, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13, 15]]) == [True]","assert is_tune([[1, 6, 3]]) == [True]","assert is_tune([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]]) == [False]","assert is_tune([[1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12]]) == [True]","assert is_tune([[3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12]]) == [True]","assert is_tune([[]]) == [False]","assert is_tune([[1]]) == [True]","assert is_tune([[-11, -9, -7, -6, -4, -2, 0, 1, 3, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13, 15]]) == [True]","assert is_tune([[-4, -2, 0, 1, 3, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13, 15]]) == [True]"],"fake_answer":["assert is_tune([[1, 3, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13, 15]]) == [True]","assert is_tune([[1, 3, 6, 8, 10, 12]]) == [True]"],"hint":null,"answer":["assert is_tune([[1, 3, 6, 8, 10, 12]]) == [True]","assert is_tune([[1, 3, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13, 15]]) == [True]","assert is_tune([[1, 6, 3]]) == [True]","assert is_tune([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]]) == [False]","assert is_tune([[1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12]]) == [True]","assert is_tune([[3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12]]) == [True]","assert is_tune([[]]) == [False]","assert is_tune([[1]]) == [True]","assert is_tune([[-11, -9, -7, -6, -4, -2, 0, 1, 3, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13, 15]]) == [True]","assert is_tune([[-4, -2, 0, 1, 3, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13, 15]]) == [True]"],"func_name":"is_tune","setup_code":""}

{"question":"PROBLEM:\n## Introduction\n\n\nEach chemical element in its neutral state has a specific number of electrons associated with it. This is represented by the **atomic number** which is noted by an integer number next to or above each element of the periodic table (as highlighted in the image above).\n\nAs we move from left to right, starting from the top row of the periodic table, each element differs from its predecessor by 1 unit (electron). Electrons fill in different orbitals sets according to a specific order. Each set of orbitals, when full, contains an even number of electrons.\n\nThe orbital sets are:\n* The _**s** orbital_ - a single orbital that can hold a maximum of 2 electrons.\n* The _**p** orbital set_ - can hold 6 electrons.\n* The _**d** orbital set_ - can hold 10 electrons.\n* The _**f** orbital set_ - can hold 14 electrons.\n\n\nThe order in which electrons are filling the different set of orbitals is shown in the picture above. First electrons will occupy the **1s** orbital, then the **2s**, then the **2p** set, **3s** and so on.\n\nElectron configurations show how the number of electrons of an element is distributed across each orbital set. Each orbital is written as a sequence that follows the order in the picture, joined by the number of electrons contained in that orbital set. The final electron configuration is a single string of orbital names and number of electrons per orbital set where the first 2 digits of each substring represent the orbital name followed by a number that states the number of electrons that the orbital set contains.\n\nFor example, a string that demonstrates an electron configuration of a chemical element that contains 10 electrons is: `1s2 2s2 2p6`. This configuration shows that there are two electrons in the `1s` orbital set, two electrons in the `2s` orbital set, and six electrons in the `2p` orbital set. `2 + 2 + 6 = 10` electrons total.\n\n___\n\n# Task\n\nYour task is to write a function that displays the electron configuration built according to the Madelung rule of all chemical elements of the periodic table. The argument will be the symbol of a chemical element, as displayed in the periodic table.\n\n**Note**: There will be a preloaded array called `ELEMENTS` with chemical elements sorted by their atomic number.\n\nFor example, when the element \"O\" is fed into the function the output should look like: \n\n`\"O -> 1s2 2s2 2p4\"`\n\nHowever, there are some exceptions!

This is represented by the **atomic number** which is noted by an integer number next to or above each element of the periodic table (as highlighted in the image above).\n\nAs we move from left to right, starting from the top row of the periodic table, each element differs from its predecessor by 1 unit (electron). Electrons fill in different orbitals sets according to a specific order. Each set of orbitals, when full, contains an even number of electrons.\n\nThe orbital sets are:\n* The _**s** orbital_ - a single orbital that can hold a maximum of 2 electrons.\n* The _**p** orbital set_ - can hold 6 electrons.\n* The _**d** orbital set_ - can hold 10 electrons.\n* The _**f** orbital set_ - can hold 14 electrons.\n\n\nThe order in which electrons are filling the different set of orbitals is shown in the picture above. First electrons will occupy the **1s** orbital, then the **2s**, then the **2p** set, **3s** and so on.\n\nElectron configurations show how the number of electrons of an element is distributed across each orbital set. Each orbital is written as a sequence that follows the order in the picture, joined by the number of electrons contained in that orbital set. The final electron configuration is a single string of orbital names and number of electrons per orbital set where the first 2 digits of each substring represent the orbital name followed by a number that states the number of electrons that the orbital set contains.\n\nFor example, a string that demonstrates an electron configuration of a chemical element that contains 10 electrons is: `1s2 2s2 2p6`. This configuration shows that there are two electrons in the `1s` orbital set, two electrons in the `2s` orbital set, and six electrons in the `2p` orbital set. `2 + 2 + 6 = 10` electrons total.\n\n___\n\n# Task\n\nYour task is to write a function that displays the electron configuration built according to the Madelung rule of all chemical elements of the periodic table. The argument will be the symbol of a chemical element, as displayed in the periodic table.\n\n**Note**: There will be a preloaded array called `ELEMENTS` with chemical elements sorted by their atomic number.\n\nFor example, when the element \"O\" is fed into the function the output should look like: \n\n`\"O -> 1s2 2s2 2p4\"`\n\nHowever, there are some exceptions! The electron configurations of the elements below should end as:\n\n```\nCr -> ...3d5 4s1\nCu -> ...3d10 4s1\nNb -> ...4d4 5s1\nMo -> ...4d5 5s1\nRu -> ...4d7 5s1\nRh -> ...4d8 5s1\nPd -> ...4d10 5s0\nAg -> ...4d10 5s1\nLa -> ...4f0 5d1\nCe -> ...4f1 5d1\nGd -> ...4f7 5d1 6s2\nPt -> ...4f14 5d9 6s1\nAu -> ...4f14 5d10 6s1\nAc -> ...5f0 6d1 7s2\nTh -> ...5f0 6d2 7s2\nPa -> ...5f2 6d1 7s2\nU  -> ...5f3 6d1 7s2\nNp -> ...5f4 6d1 7s2\nCm -> ...5f7 6d1 7s2\n```\n\n**Note**: for `Ni` the electron configuration should be `3d8 4s2` instead of `3d9 4s1`.\n\nThe function should be called get_electron_configuration and should pass all tests.

First convert it to ASCII values:\n\n```104``` for ```h```, ```101``` for ```e``` and ```121``` for ```y```.\n\n\n2. Now we convert the ASCII values to a 8-bit binary string:\n\n```104``` -> ```01101000```, ```101``` -> ```01100101``` and ```121``` -> ```01111001```\n\nif we concat the binarys we get ```011010000110010101111001```\n\n\n3.

Split the string of 0 and 1 in groups of three characters example: \"000\", \"111\"\n2. Check if an error occured:\n If no error occured the group is \"000\" or \"111\", then replace \"000\" with \"0\" and \"111\" with 1\n If an error occured the group is for example \"001\" or \"100\" or \"101\" and so on...\n Replace this group with the character that occurs most often. example: \"010\" -> \"0\" , \"110\" -> \"1\" \n\n3. Now take a group of 8 characters and convert that binary number to decimal ASCII value\n4. Convert the ASCII value to a char and well done you made it :)\n\n\n\nLook at this example carefully to understand it better:\n\nWe got a bit sequence:\n\n```100111111000111001000010000111111000000111001111000111110110111000010111``` \n\nFirst we split the bit sequence into groups of three:\n\n```100```, ```111```, ```111```, ```000```, ```111```, ```001``` ....\n\nEvery group with the most \"0\" becomes \"0\" and every group with the most \"1\" becomes \"1\":\n\n```100``` -> ```0``` Because there are two ```0``` and only one ```1```\n\n```111``` -> ```1``` Because there are zero ```0``` and three ```1```\n\n```111``` -> ```1``` Because there are zero ```0``` and three ```1```\n\n```000``` -> ```0``` Because there are three ```0``` and zero ```1```\n\n```111``` -> ```1``` Because there are zero ```0``` and three ```1```\n\n```001``` -> ```0``` Because there are two ```0``` and one ```1```\n\nNow concat all 0 and 1 to get ```011010000110010101111001```\n\nWe split this string into groups of eight:\n```01101000```, ```01100101``` and ```01111001```.\n\nAnd now convert it back to letters:\n\n```01101000``` is binary representation of 104, which is ASCII value of ```h```\n\n```01100101``` is binary representation of 101, which is ASCII value of ```e```\n\n```01111001``` is binary representation of 121, which is ASCII value of ```y```\n\nNow we got our word ```hey``` !\n\nThe function should be called encode and should pass all tests.

Check if an error occured:\n If no error occured the group is \"000\" or \"111\", then replace \"000\" with \"0\" and \"111\" with 1\n If an error occured the group is for example \"001\" or \"100\" or \"101\" and so on...\n Replace this group with the character that occurs most often. example: \"010\" -> \"0\" , \"110\" -> \"1\" \n\n3. Now take a group of 8 characters and convert that binary number to decimal ASCII value\n4. Convert the ASCII value to a char and well done you made it :)\n\n\n\nLook at this example carefully to understand it better:\n\nWe got a bit sequence:\n\n```100111111000111001000010000111111000000111001111000111110110111000010111``` \n\nFirst we split the bit sequence into groups of three:\n\n```100```, ```111```, ```111```, ```000```, ```111```, ```001``` ....\n\nEvery group with the most \"0\" becomes \"0\" and every group with the most \"1\" becomes \"1\":\n\n```100``` -> ```0``` Because there are two ```0``` and only one ```1```\n\n```111``` -> ```1``` Because there are zero ```0``` and three ```1```\n\n```111``` -> ```1``` Because there are zero ```0``` and three ```1```\n\n```000``` -> ```0``` Because there are three ```0``` and zero ```1```\n\n```111``` -> ```1``` Because there are zero ```0``` and three ```1```\n\n```001``` -> ```0``` Because there are two ```0``` and one ```1```\n\nNow concat all 0 and 1 to get ```011010000110010101111001```\n\nWe split this string into groups of eight:\n```01101000```, ```01100101``` and ```01111001```.\n\nAnd now convert it back to letters:\n\n```01101000``` is binary representation of 104, which is ASCII value of ```h```\n\n```01100101``` is binary representation of 101, which is ASCII value of ```e```\n\n```01111001``` is binary representation of 121, which is ASCII value of ```y```\n\nNow we got our word ```hey``` !\n\nThe function should be called encode and should pass all tests. Use the following starter code:\n```python\n\ndef encode(string):\n\t\n```\n\nSOLUTION:\n","role":"user"}],"gt_answer":["assert encode(['hey']) == ['000111111000111000000000000111111000000111000111000111111111111000000111']","assert encode(['The Sensei told me that i can do this kata']) == ['000111000111000111000000000111111000111000000000000111111000000111000111000000111000000000000000000111000111000000111111000111111000000111000111000111111000111111111000000111111111000000111111000111111000000111000111000111111000111000000111000000111000000000000000000111111111000111000000000111111000111111111111000111111000111111000000000111111000000111000000000000111000000000000000000111111000111111000111000111111000000111000111000000111000000000000000000111111111000111000000000111111000111000000000000111111000000000000111000111111111000111000000000000111000000000000000000111111000111000000111000000111000000000000000000111111000000000111111000111111000000000000111000111111000111111111000000000111000000000000000000111111000000111000000000111111000111111111111000000111000000000000000000111111111000111000000000111111000111000000000000111111000111000000111000111111111000000111111000000111000000000000000000111111000111000111111000111111000000000000111000111111111000111000000000111111000000000000111']","assert encode(['T3st']) == ['000111000111000111000000000000111111000000111111000111111111000000111111000111111111000111000000']","assert encode(['T?st!%']) == ['000111000111000111000000000000111111111111111111000111111111000000111111000111111111000111000000000000111000000000000111000000111000000111000111']"],"fake_answer":["assert encode(['hey']) == ['000111111000111000000000000111111000000111000111000111111111111000000111']"],"hint":null,"answer":["assert encode(['hey']) == ['000111111000111000000000000111111000000111000111000111111111111000000111']","assert encode(['The Sensei told me that i can do this kata']) == ['000111000111000111000000000111111000111000000000000111111000000111000111000000111000000000000000000111000111000000111111000111111000000111000111000111111000111111111000000111111111000000111111000111111000000111000111000111111000111000000111000000111000000000000000000111111111000111000000000111111000111111111111000111111000111111000000000111111000000111000000000000111000000000000000000111111000111111000111000111111000000111000111000000111000000000000000000111111111000111000000000111111000111000000000000111111000000000000111000111111111000111000000000000111000000000000000000111111000111000000111000000111000000000000000000111111000000000111111000111111000000000000111000111111000111111111000000000111000000000000000000111111000000111000000000111111000111111111111000000111000000000000000000111111111000111000000000111111000111000000000000111111000111000000111000111111111000000111111000000111000000000000000000111111000111000111111000111111000000000000111000111111111000111000000000111111000000000000111']","assert encode(['T3st']) == ['000111000111000111000000000000111111000000111111000111111111000000111111000111111111000111000000']","assert encode(['T?st!%']) == ['000111000111000111000000000000111111111111111111000111111111000000111111000111111111000111000000000000111000000000000111000000111000000111000111']"],"func_name":"encode","setup_code":""}

In the case of a tie combat ends with neither player losing a life.\n\nFor example:\n```\nPlayer 1: 5 Power, 0 Modifier\nPlayer 2: 3 Power, 2 Modifier\n\nPlayer 1 rolls a 4, Player 2 rolls a 2.\n\n(5 + 0 + 4) -> (3 + 2 + 2)\nPlayer 1 wins (9 > 7)\n```\n\nYour task is to write a method that calculates the required roll for the player to win.\n\nThe player and enemy stats are given as an array in the format:\n```python\n[power, modifier]\n```\n\nFor example for the examples used above the stats would be given as:\n```python\nget_required([5, 0], [3, 2]) # returns 'Random'\n```\n\nIf the player has at least 6 more power (including modifiers) than the enemy they automatically wins the fight, as the enemy's combat score couldn't possibly exceed the player's. In this instance the method should return \"Auto-win\".\n\nFor example:\n```python\nget_required([9, 0], [2, 1]) # returns 'Auto-win' as the enemy can't possibly win\n```\n\nIf the enemy has at least 6 more power (including modifiers) than the player they automatically wins the fight, as the player's combat score couldn't possibly exceed the enemy's. In this instance the method should return \"Auto-lose\".\n\nFor example:\n```python\nget_required([2, 1], [9, 0]) # returns 'Auto-lose' as the player can't possibly win\n```\n\nIf the player and enemy have the same power (including modifiers) the outcome is purely down to the dice roll, and hence would be considered completely random. In this instance the method should return \"Random\".\n\nFor example (as above):\n```python\nget_required([5, 0], [3, 2]) # returns 'Random' as it is purely down to the dice roll\n```\n\nIf the player has greater power than the enemy (including modifiers) the player could guarantee a win by rolling a high enough number on the dice. In this instance the method should return a range equal to the numbers which would guarantee victory for the player.\n\n```python\nget_required([6, 0], [2, 2]) # returns '(5..6)' as rolling a 5 or 6 would mean the enemy could not win\nget_required([7, 1], [2, 2]) # returns '(3..6)' as rolling anything 3 through 6 would mean the enemy could not win\n```\n\nIf the player has less power than the enemy (including modifiers) the player can only win if the enemy rolls a low enough number, providing they then roll a high enough number. In this instance the method should return a range equal to the numbers which would allow the player a chance to win.\n\n```python\nget_required([4, 0], [6, 0]) # returns '(1..3)' as this would be the only outcome for which the player could still win\nget_required([1, 1], [6, 0]) # returns '(1..1)' as this would be the only outcome for which the player could still win\n```\n\nIf the better case scenario for the player is to hope for a tie, then return `\"Pray for a tie!\"`.\n\n```python\nget_required([7, 2], [6, 8]) # returns \"Pray for a tie!\"\n```\n\nThe function should be called get_required and should pass all tests.

The player with the highest combat score wins and the opposing player loses a life. In the case of a tie combat ends with neither player losing a life.\n\nFor example:\n```\nPlayer 1: 5 Power, 0 Modifier\nPlayer 2: 3 Power, 2 Modifier\n\nPlayer 1 rolls a 4, Player 2 rolls a 2.\n\n(5 + 0 + 4) -> (3 + 2 + 2)\nPlayer 1 wins (9 > 7)\n```\n\nYour task is to write a method that calculates the required roll for the player to win.\n\nThe player and enemy stats are given as an array in the format:\n```python\n[power, modifier]\n```\n\nFor example for the examples used above the stats would be given as:\n```python\nget_required([5, 0], [3, 2]) # returns 'Random'\n```\n\nIf the player has at least 6 more power (including modifiers) than the enemy they automatically wins the fight, as the enemy's combat score couldn't possibly exceed the player's. In this instance the method should return \"Auto-win\".\n\nFor example:\n```python\nget_required([9, 0], [2, 1]) # returns 'Auto-win' as the enemy can't possibly win\n```\n\nIf the enemy has at least 6 more power (including modifiers) than the player they automatically wins the fight, as the player's combat score couldn't possibly exceed the enemy's. In this instance the method should return \"Auto-lose\".\n\nFor example:\n```python\nget_required([2, 1], [9, 0]) # returns 'Auto-lose' as the player can't possibly win\n```\n\nIf the player and enemy have the same power (including modifiers) the outcome is purely down to the dice roll, and hence would be considered completely random. In this instance the method should return \"Random\".\n\nFor example (as above):\n```python\nget_required([5, 0], [3, 2]) # returns 'Random' as it is purely down to the dice roll\n```\n\nIf the player has greater power than the enemy (including modifiers) the player could guarantee a win by rolling a high enough number on the dice. In this instance the method should return a range equal to the numbers which would guarantee victory for the player.\n\n```python\nget_required([6, 0], [2, 2]) # returns '(5..6)' as rolling a 5 or 6 would mean the enemy could not win\nget_required([7, 1], [2, 2]) # returns '(3..6)' as rolling anything 3 through 6 would mean the enemy could not win\n```\n\nIf the player has less power than the enemy (including modifiers) the player can only win if the enemy rolls a low enough number, providing they then roll a high enough number. In this instance the method should return a range equal to the numbers which would allow the player a chance to win.\n\n```python\nget_required([4, 0], [6, 0]) # returns '(1..3)' as this would be the only outcome for which the player could still win\nget_required([1, 1], [6, 0]) # returns '(1..1)' as this would be the only outcome for which the player could still win\n```\n\nIf the better case scenario for the player is to hope for a tie, then return `\"Pray for a tie!\"`.\n\n```python\nget_required([7, 2], [6, 8]) # returns \"Pray for a tie!\"\n```\n\nThe function should be called get_required and should pass all tests.

{"question":"PROBLEM:\nA chess position can be expressed as a string using the  Forsyth\u2013Edwards Notation (FEN). Your task is to write a parser that reads in a FEN-encoded string and returns a depiction of the board using the Unicode chess symbols (\u2654,\u2655,\u2658,etc.). The board should be drawn from the perspective of the active color (i.e. the side making the next move). \n\nUsing the CodeWars dark theme is strongly recommended for this kata. Otherwise, the colors will appear to be inverted.\n\nThe complete FEN format contains 6 fields separated by spaces, but we will only consider the first two fields: Piece placement and active color (side-to-move). The rules for these fields are as follows:\n\nThe first field of the FEN describes piece placement.\nEach row ('rank') of the board is described one-by-one, starting with rank 8 (the far side of the board from White's perspective) and ending with rank 1 (White's home rank). Rows are separated by a forward slash ('\/').\nWithin each row, the contents of the squares are listed starting with the \"a-file\" (White's left) and ending with the \"h-file\" (White's right).\nEach piece is identified by a single letter: pawn = P, knight = N, bishop = B, rook = R, queen = Q and king = K. White pieces are upper-case (PNBRQK), while black pieces are lowercase (pnbrqk).\nEmpty squares are represented using the digits 1 through 8 to denote the number of consecutive empty squares.\nThe piece placement field is followed by a single space, then a single character representing the color who has the next move ('w' for White and 'b' for Black).\nFour additional fields follow the active color, separated by spaces.

{"question":"PROBLEM:\nYou are to write a function to transpose a guitar tab up or down a number of semitones. The amount to transpose is a number, positive or negative. The tab is given as an array, with six elements for each guitar string (fittingly passed as strings). Output your tab in a similar form.\n\nGuitar tablature (or 'tab') is an alternative to sheet music, where notes are replaced by fret numbers and the five lines of the staff are replaced by six lines to represent each of the guitar's strings. It is still read from left to right like sheet music, and notes written directly above each other are played at the same time.\n\nFor example, Led Zeppelin's Stairway to Heaven begins:\n```\ne|-------5-7-----7-|-8-----8-2-----2-|-0---------0-----|-----------------|\nB|-----5-----5-----|---5-------3-----|---1---1-----1---|-0-1-1-----------|\nG|---5---------5---|-----5-------2---|-----2---------2-|-0-2-2-----------|\nD|-7-------6-------|-5-------4-------|-3---------------|-----------------|\nA|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-2-0-0---0--\/8-7-|\nE|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n```\nTransposed up two semitones, it would look like this:\n```\ne|-------7-9-----9-|-10-----10-4-----4-|-2---------2-----|------------------|\nB|-----7-----7-----|----7--------5-----|---3---3-----3---|-2-3-3------------|\nG|---7---------7---|------7--------4---|-----4---------4-|-2-4-4------------|\nD|-9-------8-------|-7---------6-------|-5---------------|------------------|\nA|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|-4-2-2---2--\/10-9-|\nE|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|------------------|\n```\nNote how when the 8th fret note on the top string in bar 2 gets transposed to the 10th fret, extra '-' are added on the other strings below so as to retain the single '-' that originally separated that beat (i.e. column) from the following note \u2013 fret 7 on the B string.\n\nEach beat must retain at least one '-' separator before the next, to keep the tab legible. The inputted test tabs all obey this convention.\n\nElectric guitars usually have 22 frets, with the 0th fret being an open string. If your fret numbers transpose to either negative values or values over 22, you should return 'Out of frets!' (and probably detune your guitar).\n\nTests include some randomly generated guitar tabs, which come with no guarantee of musical quality and\/or playability...!\n\nThe function should be called transpose and should pass all tests.

{"question":"PROBLEM:\nYour task is to determine the top 3 place finishes in a pole vault competition involving several different competitors. This is isn't always so simple, and it is often a source of confusion for people who don't know the actual rules.\n\nHere's what you need to know:\n\nAs input, you will receive an array of objects. Each object contains the respective competitor's name (as a string) and his\/her results at the various bar heights (as an array of strings):\n\n[{name: \"Sergey\", results: [\"\", \"O\", \"XO\", \"O\", \"XXO\", \"XXX\", \"\", \"\"]}{name: \"Jan\", results: [\"\", \"\", \"\", \"O\", \"O\", \"XO\", \"XXO\", \"XXX\"]}{name: \"Bruce\", results: [\"\", \"XO\", \"XXO\", \"XXX\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\"]}{name: \"HerrWert\", results: [\"XXX\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\"]}]\n\nIn the array of strings described above, each string represents the vaulter's performance at a given height. The possible values are based on commonly used written notations on a pole vault scoresheet:\nAn empty string indicates that the vaulter did not jump at this height for a variety of possible reasons (\"passed\" at this height, was temporarily called away to a different track and field event, was already eliminated from competition, or withdrew due to injury, for example).An upper-case X in the string represents an unsuccessful attempt at the height. (As you may know, the vaulter is eliminated from the competition after three consecutive failed attempts.)An upper-case O represents a successful attempt. If present at all, this will be the final character in the string, because it indicates that the vaulter has now successfully completed this height and is ready to move on.\n\nAll vaulters will have a result string (though possibly empty) for every height involved in the competition, making it possible to match up the results of different vaulters with less confusion.\n\nObviously, your first task is to determine who cleared the greatest height successfully. In other words, who has a \"O\" mark at a higher array element than any other competitor? You might want to work through the arrays from right to left to determine this. In the most straightforward case, you would first determine the winner, then second place, and finally third place by this simple logic.\n\nBut what if there's a tie for one of these finishing places? Proceed as follows (according to American high school rules, at least):\nFirst trace backwards to find the greatest height that both vaulters cleared successfully. Then determine who had the fewest unsuccessful attempts at this height (i.e., the fewest X's in the string for this height). This person wins the tie-break.But what if they're still tied with one another?  Do NOT continue to trace backwards through the heights! Instead, compare their total numbers of unsuccessful attempts at all heights in the competition. The vaulter with the fewest total misses wins the tie-break.But what if they're still tied? It depends on the finishing place:If it's for second or third place, the tie stands (i.e., is not broken).But if it's for first place, there must be a jump-off (like overtime or penalty kicks in other sports) to break the tie and determine the winner. (This jump-off occurs - hypothetically - after your code runs and is thus not a part of this kata.)\n\nReturn a single object as your result. Each place-finish that is included in the results (including at least first place as property \"1st\" and possibly second and third places as properties \"2nd\" and \"3rd\") should have as its value the respective vaulter's name. In the event of a tie, the value of the property is the names of all tied vaulters, in alphabetical order, separated by commas, and followed by the notation \"(jump-off)\" if the tie is for first place or \"(tie)\" if it's for second or third place.\n\nHere are some possible outcomes to show you what I mean:\n{1st: \"Jan\", 2nd: \"Sergey\"; 3rd: \"Bruce\"} (These results correspond to the sample input data given above.){1st: \"Julia\", 2nd: \"Madi, Emily (tie)}\"{1st: \"Caleb, Dustin (jump-off)\", 3rd: \"Sam\"}{1st: \"Meredith\", 2nd: \"Maddy\", 3rd: \"Cierra, Sara (tie)\"}{1st: \"Alex, Basti, Max (jump-off)\"}\n\nIf you are familiar with the awarding of place finishes in sporting events or team standings in a league, then you know that there won't necessarily be a 2nd or 3rd place, because ties in higher places \"bump\"  all lower places downward accordingly.\n\nOne more thing: You really shouldn't change the array of objects that you receive as input. This represents the physical scoresheet. We need this \"original document\" to be intact, so that we can refer back to it to resolve a disputed result!\n\nHave fun with this!\n\n- - - - -\n\nNotes for the Python version:\n\nThe rules for the Python version are the same as the original JavaScript version. \n\nThe input and output will look the same as the JavaScript version. But, the JavaScript objects will be replaced by Python dictionaries. The JavaScript arrays will be replaced by Python lists. The Python function name was changed to include underscores as is customary with Python names.

Output the code in the following format: ```python\n<code>\n```","role":"system"},{"content":"PROBLEM:\nYour task is to determine the top 3 place finishes in a pole vault competition involving several different competitors. This is isn't always so simple, and it is often a source of confusion for people who don't know the actual rules.\n\nHere's what you need to know:\n\nAs input, you will receive an array of objects. Each object contains the respective competitor's name (as a string) and his\/her results at the various bar heights (as an array of strings):\n\n[{name: \"Sergey\", results: [\"\", \"O\", \"XO\", \"O\", \"XXO\", \"XXX\", \"\", \"\"]}{name: \"Jan\", results: [\"\", \"\", \"\", \"O\", \"O\", \"XO\", \"XXO\", \"XXX\"]}{name: \"Bruce\", results: [\"\", \"XO\", \"XXO\", \"XXX\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\"]}{name: \"HerrWert\", results: [\"XXX\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\"]}]\n\nIn the array of strings described above, each string represents the vaulter's performance at a given height. The possible values are based on commonly used written notations on a pole vault scoresheet:\nAn empty string indicates that the vaulter did not jump at this height for a variety of possible reasons (\"passed\" at this height, was temporarily called away to a different track and field event, was already eliminated from competition, or withdrew due to injury, for example).An upper-case X in the string represents an unsuccessful attempt at the height. (As you may know, the vaulter is eliminated from the competition after three consecutive failed attempts.)An upper-case O represents a successful attempt. If present at all, this will be the final character in the string, because it indicates that the vaulter has now successfully completed this height and is ready to move on.\n\nAll vaulters will have a result string (though possibly empty) for every height involved in the competition, making it possible to match up the results of different vaulters with less confusion.\n\nObviously, your first task is to determine who cleared the greatest height successfully. In other words, who has a \"O\" mark at a higher array element than any other competitor? You might want to work through the arrays from right to left to determine this. In the most straightforward case, you would first determine the winner, then second place, and finally third place by this simple logic.\n\nBut what if there's a tie for one of these finishing places? Proceed as follows (according to American high school rules, at least):\nFirst trace backwards to find the greatest height that both vaulters cleared successfully. Then determine who had the fewest unsuccessful attempts at this height (i.e., the fewest X's in the string for this height). This person wins the tie-break.But what if they're still tied with one another?  Do NOT continue to trace backwards through the heights! Instead, compare their total numbers of unsuccessful attempts at all heights in the competition. The vaulter with the fewest total misses wins the tie-break.But what if they're still tied? It depends on the finishing place:If it's for second or third place, the tie stands (i.e., is not broken).But if it's for first place, there must be a jump-off (like overtime or penalty kicks in other sports) to break the tie and determine the winner. (This jump-off occurs - hypothetically - after your code runs and is thus not a part of this kata.)\n\nReturn a single object as your result. Each place-finish that is included in the results (including at least first place as property \"1st\" and possibly second and third places as properties \"2nd\" and \"3rd\") should have as its value the respective vaulter's name. In the event of a tie, the value of the property is the names of all tied vaulters, in alphabetical order, separated by commas, and followed by the notation \"(jump-off)\" if the tie is for first place or \"(tie)\" if it's for second or third place.\n\nHere are some possible outcomes to show you what I mean:\n{1st: \"Jan\", 2nd: \"Sergey\"; 3rd: \"Bruce\"} (These results correspond to the sample input data given above.){1st: \"Julia\", 2nd: \"Madi, Emily (tie)}\"{1st: \"Caleb, Dustin (jump-off)\", 3rd: \"Sam\"}{1st: \"Meredith\", 2nd: \"Maddy\", 3rd: \"Cierra, Sara (tie)\"}{1st: \"Alex, Basti, Max (jump-off)\"}\n\nIf you are familiar with the awarding of place finishes in sporting events or team standings in a league, then you know that there won't necessarily be a 2nd or 3rd place, because ties in higher places \"bump\"  all lower places downward accordingly.\n\nOne more thing: You really shouldn't change the array of objects that you receive as input. This represents the physical scoresheet. We need this \"original document\" to be intact, so that we can refer back to it to resolve a disputed result!\n\nHave fun with this!\n\n- - - - -\n\nNotes for the Python version:\n\nThe rules for the Python version are the same as the original JavaScript version. \n\nThe input and output will look the same as the JavaScript version. But, the JavaScript objects will be replaced by Python dictionaries. The JavaScript arrays will be replaced by Python lists. The Python function name was changed to include underscores as is customary with Python names. The example below should help clarify all of this.\n\nThe input for the Python version will be a list containing dictionaries with the competitors' names and results. The names in the dictionaries are strings. The results are lists with a list of strings. And example follows.\n\nscore_pole_vault([\n        {\"name\": \"Linda\", \"results\": [\"XXO\", \"O\",\"XXO\", \"O\"]},\n        {\"name\": \"Vickie\", \"results\": [\"O\",\"X\", \"\", \"\"]},\n        {\"name\": \"Debbie\", \"results\": [\"XXO\", \"O\",\"XO\", \"XXX\"]},\n        {\"name\": \"Michelle\", \"results\": [\"XO\",\"XO\",\"XXX\",\"\"]},\n        {\"name\": \"Carol\", \"results\": [\"XXX\", \"\",\"\",\"\"]}\n])\n\n\nThe returned results should be in a dictionary with one to three elements. \n\nExamples of possible returned results:\n\n  {'1st': 'Linda', '2nd': 'Debbie', '3rd': 'Michelle'}\n\n  {'1st': 'Green, Hayes (jump-off)', '3rd': 'Garcia'}           \n  Note: Since first place was tied in this case, there is no 2nd place awarded.\n\n  {'1st': 'Wilson', '2nd': 'Laurie', '3rd': 'Joyce, Moore (tie)'}\n  \nI have tried to create test cases that have every concievable tie situation.\n\nHave fun with this version, as well!\n\nThe function should be called score_pole_vault and should pass all tests.

{"question":"PROBLEM:\n## Check Digits\n\nSome numbers are more important to get right during data entry than others: a common example is product codes.\n\nTo reduce the possibility of mistakes, product codes can be crafted in such a way that simple errors are detected. This is done by calculating a single-digit value based on the product number, and then appending that digit to the product number to arrive at the product code.\n\nWhen the product code is checked, the check digit value is stripped off and recalculated. If the supplied value does not match the recalculated value, the product code is rejected.\n\nA simple scheme for generating self-check digits, described here, is called Modulus 11 Self-Check.\n\n## Calculation method\n\nEach digit in the product number is assigned a multiplication factor. The factors are assigned ***from right to left***, starting at `2` and counting up. For numbers longer than six digits, the factors restart at `2` after `7` is reached. The product of each digit and its factor is calculated, and the products summed. For example:\n\n```python\ndigit     :  1    6    7    7    0    3    6    2    5\nfactor    :  4    3    2    7    6    5    4    3    2\n           ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---\n             4 + 18 + 14 + 49 +  0 + 15 + 24 +  6 + 10 = 140\n```\n\nThen the sum of the products is divided by the prime number `11`. The remainder is inspected, and:\n\n* if the remainder is `0`, the check digit is also `0`\n* if the remainder is `1`, the check digit is replaced by an uppercase `X`\n* for all others, the remainder is subtracted from `11`\n\nThe result is the **check digit**.\n\n## Your task\n\nYour task is to implement this algorithm and return the input number with the correct check digit appended.\n\n## Examples\n\n```python\ninput: \"036532\"\n\nproduct sum = 2*2 + 3*3 + 5*4 + 6*5 + 3*6 + 0*7 = 81\nremainder   = 81 mod 11 = 4\ncheck digit = 11 - 4 = 7\n\noutput: \"0365327\"\n```\n\nThe function should be called add_check_digit and should pass all tests.

You can skip it, if you already know how it works:\n\n### Postionning information\n\nFirst of all we have to take a look at the big three positioning fields in the corners.\n\n\n\nYou can see on the image that these fields are connected.  \nThe fields are just there for the positioning and I told before that the qr code will be always positioned correctly so you can ignore them.\n\n### Mask information\n\nThe bits next to the positioning fields give us information about the mask and the error correction level the qr code uses. I wrote above that it is always mask 0 and always error correction level H, so we can also ignore that stuff.\n\n\n\n### Reading information\n\nNow we start with the important stuff. Go through the qr code like the red arrow shows on this picture (btw I made it with paint so don't judge me)\n- We start in the lower right corner\n- Then we go one to the left\n- Then we go one up and one to the right\n- And so on just look the red arrow\n\n___Important:___ Remember that everything inside the blue boxes has another purpose than encoding information, so don't forget to skip those parts.\n\n\n\nIn the image below, you may find the complete pattern to read information in a QR-code. But keep in mind you'll be handling only \"QR-code version 1\", so you don't need to read the full set of data (see picture at the top if needed).\n\n\n\n### Decoding information\n\nWe have to build a bit sequence now. In order to do that we will use mask 0 definition which is `((x+y)%2)==0`, where:\n- x and y are the indexes of our 2 dimensional array (0-based)\n- if the condition of our mask is true, we have to convert the pixel: black -> 0 and white -> 1\n- A mask is used to prevent long sequences of identical bits so that a scanner can better recognize the code\n\nFor each black field add 1 to our bit sequence and for each white field add 0 to our bit sequence, don't forget that many bits get converted because of mask 0.\n\nLet's do the first bits together:\n\n* We start with the first pixel (in the lower right corner, where also the red arrow begins) which is black, but we have to use mask because (20+20)%2 is 0, therefore we don't add 1 to our bit sequence but 0.\n* Next field is white. This time we don't use mask because (20+19)%2 isn't 0, so we add a 0 to our bit sequence.\n* Next field is black. This time we don't use mask because (19+20)%2 isn't 0, so we add a 1 to our bit sequence.\n\nImportant (!): Since we're limiting ourselves to version 1, we have to continue that process only until our bit sequence is 76 long, because the input will never be longer than eight characters.\n\nAt the end you get a bit sequence:\n```\nbits:      0100000000100100100001101001000011101100000100011110110000010001111011001111\nlegend:    MMMMssssssss...\n\n- \"M\": mode bits (4 bits)\n- \"s\": size message bits (8 bits)\n- ...: message bits and error correction information\n```\n\nThis bit sequence is representing the following information\n* First 4 bits show mode: `0100`. This isn't important for us, because I told you before that we will use always byte mode in this kata.\n* The following 8 bits show the length of the encoded word: `00000010`. This is the binary representation of number 2, so we know our word is 2 characters long.\n* The following bits are data bits followed by error correction bits (but you can ignore error correction bits, because there won't be any errors). We know our word is 2 chars long, so we take the next 16 bits (because 1 char=8 bits):\n  - First group of 8 bits: `01001000`. This is `72` in decimal which is ascii value of `\"H\"`.\n  - Second group of 8 bits: `01101001`. This is `105` in decimal which is ascii value of `\"i\"`.\n\nSince we don't handle in this kata error correction, we got our word\/output: `\"Hi\"`.\n\nGood luck :)\n\nThe function should be called scanner and should pass all tests.

You can skip it, if you already know how it works:\n\n### Postionning information\n\nFirst of all we have to take a look at the big three positioning fields in the corners.\n\n\n\nYou can see on the image that these fields are connected.  \nThe fields are just there for the positioning and I told before that the qr code will be always positioned correctly so you can ignore them.\n\n### Mask information\n\nThe bits next to the positioning fields give us information about the mask and the error correction level the qr code uses. I wrote above that it is always mask 0 and always error correction level H, so we can also ignore that stuff.\n\n\n\n### Reading information\n\nNow we start with the important stuff. Go through the qr code like the red arrow shows on this picture (btw I made it with paint so don't judge me)\n- We start in the lower right corner\n- Then we go one to the left\n- Then we go one up and one to the right\n- And so on just look the red arrow\n\n___Important:___ Remember that everything inside the blue boxes has another purpose than encoding information, so don't forget to skip those parts.\n\n\n\nIn the image below, you may find the complete pattern to read information in a QR-code. But keep in mind you'll be handling only \"QR-code version 1\", so you don't need to read the full set of data (see picture at the top if needed).\n\n\n\n### Decoding information\n\nWe have to build a bit sequence now. In order to do that we will use mask 0 definition which is `((x+y)%2)==0`, where:\n- x and y are the indexes of our 2 dimensional array (0-based)\n- if the condition of our mask is true, we have to convert the pixel: black -> 0 and white -> 1\n- A mask is used to prevent long sequences of identical bits so that a scanner can better recognize the code\n\nFor each black field add 1 to our bit sequence and for each white field add 0 to our bit sequence, don't forget that many bits get converted because of mask 0.\n\nLet's do the first bits together:\n\n* We start with the first pixel (in the lower right corner, where also the red arrow begins) which is black, but we have to use mask because (20+20)%2 is 0, therefore we don't add 1 to our bit sequence but 0.\n* Next field is white. This time we don't use mask because (20+19)%2 isn't 0, so we add a 0 to our bit sequence.\n* Next field is black. This time we don't use mask because (19+20)%2 isn't 0, so we add a 1 to our bit sequence.\n\nImportant (!): Since we're limiting ourselves to version 1, we have to continue that process only until our bit sequence is 76 long, because the input will never be longer than eight characters.\n\nAt the end you get a bit sequence:\n```\nbits:      0100000000100100100001101001000011101100000100011110110000010001111011001111\nlegend:    MMMMssssssss...\n\n- \"M\": mode bits (4 bits)\n- \"s\": size message bits (8 bits)\n- ...: message bits and error correction information\n```\n\nThis bit sequence is representing the following information\n* First 4 bits show mode: `0100`. This isn't important for us, because I told you before that we will use always byte mode in this kata.\n* The following 8 bits show the length of the encoded word: `00000010`. This is the binary representation of number 2, so we know our word is 2 characters long.\n* The following bits are data bits followed by error correction bits (but you can ignore error correction bits, because there won't be any errors). We know our word is 2 chars long, so we take the next 16 bits (because 1 char=8 bits):\n  - First group of 8 bits: `01001000`. This is `72` in decimal which is ascii value of `\"H\"`.\n  - Second group of 8 bits: `01101001`. This is `105` in decimal which is ascii value of `\"i\"`.\n\nSince we don't handle in this kata error correction, we got our word\/output: `\"Hi\"`.\n\nGood luck :)\n\nThe function should be called scanner and should pass all tests. Use the following starter code:\n```python\n\ndef scanner(qrcode):\n\t\n```\n\nSOLUTION:\n","role":"user"}],"gt_answer":["assert scanner([[[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1,

{"question":"PROBLEM:\n## Overview\nResistors are electrical components marked with colorful stripes\/bands to indicate both their resistance value in ohms and how tight a tolerance that value has. While you could always get a tattoo like Jimmie Rodgers to help you remember the resistor color codes, in the meantime, you can write a function that will take a string containing a resistor's band colors and return a string identifying the resistor's ohms and tolerance values.\n\n## The resistor color codes\nYou can see this Wikipedia page for a colorful chart, but the basic resistor color codes are:\n\nblack: 0, brown: 1, red: 2, orange: 3, yellow: 4, green: 5, blue: 6, violet: 7, gray: 8, white: 9\n\nEach resistor will have at least three bands, with the first and second bands indicating the first two digits of the ohms value, and the third indicating the power of ten to multiply them by, for example a resistor with the three bands \"yellow violet black\" would be 47 * 10^0 ohms, or 47 ohms.\n\nMost resistors will also have a fourth band that is either gold or silver, with gold indicating plus or minus 5% tolerance, and silver indicating 10% tolerance. Resistors that do not have a fourth band are rated at 20% tolerance. (There are also more specialized resistors which can have more bands and additional meanings for some of the colors, but this kata will not cover them.)\n\n## Your mission\nThe way the ohms value needs to be formatted in the string you return depends on the magnitude of the value:\n\n* For resistors less than 1000 ohms, return a string containing the number of ohms, a space, the word \"ohms\" followed by a comma and a space, the tolerance value (5, 10, or 20), and a percent sign.

While you could always get a tattoo like Jimmie Rodgers to help you remember the resistor color codes, in the meantime, you can write a function that will take a string containing a resistor's band colors and return a string identifying the resistor's ohms and tolerance values.\n\n## The resistor color codes\nYou can see this Wikipedia page for a colorful chart, but the basic resistor color codes are:\n\nblack: 0, brown: 1, red: 2, orange: 3, yellow: 4, green: 5, blue: 6, violet: 7, gray: 8, white: 9\n\nEach resistor will have at least three bands, with the first and second bands indicating the first two digits of the ohms value, and the third indicating the power of ten to multiply them by, for example a resistor with the three bands \"yellow violet black\" would be 47 * 10^0 ohms, or 47 ohms.\n\nMost resistors will also have a fourth band that is either gold or silver, with gold indicating plus or minus 5% tolerance, and silver indicating 10% tolerance. Resistors that do not have a fourth band are rated at 20% tolerance. (There are also more specialized resistors which can have more bands and additional meanings for some of the colors, but this kata will not cover them.)\n\n## Your mission\nThe way the ohms value needs to be formatted in the string you return depends on the magnitude of the value:\n\n* For resistors less than 1000 ohms, return a string containing the number of ohms, a space, the word \"ohms\" followed by a comma and a space, the tolerance value (5, 10, or 20), and a percent sign. For example,  for the \"yellow violet black\" resistor mentioned above, you would return `\"47 ohms, 20%\"`. \n\n* For resistors greater than or equal to 1000 ohms, but less than 1000000 ohms, you will use the same format as above, except that the ohms value will be divided by 1000 and have a lower-case \"k\" after it. For example, for a resistor with bands of \"yellow violet red gold\", you would return `\"4.7k ohms, 5%\"`\n\n* For resistors of 1000000 ohms or greater, you will divide the ohms value by 1000000 and have an upper-case \"M\" after it. For example, for a resistor with bands of \"brown black green silver\", you would return `\"1M ohms, 10%\"`\n\nTest case resistor values will all be between 10 ohms and 990M ohms.\n\n## More examples, featuring some common resistor values\n```\n\"brown black black\"                \"10 ohms, 20%\"\n\"brown black brown gold\"          \"100 ohms, 5%\"\n\"red red brown\"                   \"220 ohms, 20%\"\n\"orange orange brown gold\"        \"330 ohms, 5%\"\n\"yellow violet brown silver\"      \"470 ohms, 10%\"\n\"blue gray brown\"                 \"680 ohms, 20%\"\n\"brown black red silver\"           \"1k ohms, 10%\"\n\"brown black orange\"              \"10k ohms, 20%\"\n\"red red orange silver\"           \"22k ohms, 10%\"\n\"yellow violet orange gold\"       \"47k ohms, 5%\"\n\"brown black yellow gold\"        \"100k ohms, 5%\"\n\"orange orange yellow gold\"      \"330k ohms, 5%\"\n\"red black green gold\"             \"2M ohms, 5%\"\n```\nHave fun!

{"question":"PROBLEM:\nIn the wake of the npm's `left-pad` debacle, you decide to write a new super padding method that superceds the functionality of `left-pad`. Your version will provide the same functionality, but will additionally add right, and justified padding of string -- the `super_pad`.\n\nYour function `super_pad` should take three arguments: the string `string`, the width of the final string `width`, and a fill character `fill`. However, the fill character can be enriched with a format string resulting in different padding strategies.

There are two teams and each hand consists of 5 tricks. The team who wins the majority of the tricks will win points but the number of points varies. To determine the number of points, you must know which team called trump, how many tricks each team won, and if anyone went alone. Scoring is as follows:\n\nFor the team that called trump:\n\n- if they win 2 or less tricks -> other team wins 2 points\n\n- if they win 3 or 4 tricks -> 1 point\n\n- if they don't go alone and win 5 tricks -> 2 points\n\n- if they go alone and win 5 tricks -> 4 points\n\nOnly the team who called trump can go alone and you will notice that it only increases your points if you win all 5 tricks.\n\n\nYour job is to create a method to calculate the new score.

Note that if `m-n` is big enough, you might have a lot of possible answers. \n\nEach answer should be given as `[\"M: f\", \"B: b\", \"C: c\"]` and all the answers as `[ [\"M: f\", \"B: b\", \"C: c\"], ... ]`. \"M\" stands for money, \"B\" for boats, \"C\" for cars.\n\n**Note:** `m, n, f, b, c` are positive integers, where `0 <= m <= n` or `m >= n >= 0`. `m` and `n` are inclusive.\n\n\n## Examples:\n```\nhowmuch(1, 100)      => [[\"M: 37\", \"B: 5\", \"C: 4\"], [\"M: 100\", \"B: 14\", \"C: 11\"]]\nhowmuch(1000, 1100)  => [[\"M: 1045\", \"B: 149\", \"C: 116\"]]\nhowmuch(10000, 9950) => [[\"M: 9991\", \"B: 1427\", \"C: 1110\"]]\nhowmuch(0, 200)      => [[\"M: 37\", \"B: 5\", \"C: 4\"], [\"M: 100\", \"B: 14\", \"C: 11\"], [\"M: 163\", \"B: 23\", \"C: 18\"]]\n```\n\nExplanation of the results for `howmuch(1, 100)`:\n\n* In the first answer his possible fortune is **37**:\n * so he can buy 7 boats each worth 5: `37 - 7 * 5 = 2`\n * or he can buy 9 cars worth 4 each: `37 - 9 * 4 = 1`\n* The second possible answer is **100**:\n * he can buy 7 boats each worth 14: `100 - 7 * 14 = 2`\n * or he can buy 9 cars worth 11: `100 - 9 * 11 = 1`\n\n# Note\nSee \"Sample Tests\" to know the format of the return.\n\nThe function should be called howmuch and should pass all tests.

Use the following starter code:\n```python\n\ndef check_root(string):\n\t\n```\n\nSOLUTION:\n","role":"user"}],"gt_answer":["assert check_root(['4,5,6,7']) == ['841, 29']","assert check_root(['3,s,5,6']) == ['incorrect input']","assert check_root(['11,13,14,15']) == ['not consecutive']","assert check_root(['10,11,12,13,15']) == ['incorrect input']","assert check_root(['10,11,12,13']) == ['17161, 131']","assert check_root(['ad,d,q,tt,v']) == ['incorrect input']","assert check_root(['\/\/,;;,\/,..,']) == ['incorrect input']","assert check_root(['1,2,3,4']) == ['25, 5']","assert check_root(['1015,1016,1017,1018']) == ['1067648959441, 1033271']","assert check_root(['555,777,444,111']) == ['not consecutive']","assert check_root(['20,21,22,24']) == ['not consecutive']","assert check_root(['9,10,10,11']) == ['not consecutive']","assert check_root(['11254,11255,11256,11258']) == ['not consecutive']","assert check_root(['25000,25001,25002,25003']) == ['390718756875150001, 625075001']","assert check_root(['2000000,2000001,2000002,2000003']) == ['16000048000044000012000001, 4000006000001']","assert check_root(['4,5,6,q']) == ['incorrect input']","assert check_root(['5,6,7']) == ['incorrect input']","assert check_root(['3,5,6,7']) == ['not consecutive']","assert check_root(['-4,-3,-2,-1']) == ['25, 5']","assert check_root(['-1,0,1,2']) == ['1, 1']"],"fake_answer":["assert check_root(['10,11,12,13,15']) == ['incorrect input']","assert check_root(['4,5,6,7']) == ['841, 29']","assert check_root(['1015,1016,1017,1018']) == ['1067648959441, 1033271']"],"hint":null,"answer":["assert check_root(['4,5,6,7']) == ['841, 29']","assert check_root(['3,s,5,6']) == ['incorrect input']","assert check_root(['11,13,14,15']) == ['not consecutive']","assert check_root(['10,11,12,13,15']) == ['incorrect input']","assert check_root(['10,11,12,13']) == ['17161, 131']","assert check_root(['ad,d,q,tt,v']) == ['incorrect input']","assert check_root(['\/\/,;;,\/,..,']) == ['incorrect input']","assert check_root(['1,2,3,4']) == ['25, 5']","assert check_root(['1015,1016,1017,1018']) == ['1067648959441, 1033271']","assert check_root(['555,777,444,111']) == ['not consecutive']","assert check_root(['20,21,22,24']) == ['not consecutive']","assert check_root(['9,10,10,11']) == ['not consecutive']","assert check_root(['11254,11255,11256,11258']) == ['not consecutive']","assert check_root(['25000,25001,25002,25003']) == ['390718756875150001, 625075001']","assert check_root(['2000000,2000001,2000002,2000003']) == ['16000048000044000012000001, 4000006000001']","assert check_root(['4,5,6,q']) == ['incorrect input']","assert check_root(['5,6,7']) == ['incorrect input']","assert check_root(['3,5,6,7']) == ['not consecutive']","assert check_root(['-4,-3,-2,-1']) == ['25, 5']","assert check_root(['-1,0,1,2']) == ['1, 1']"],"func_name":"check_root","setup_code":""}

Use the following starter code:\n```python\n\ndef alternate_sq_sum(arr):\n\t\n```\n\nSOLUTION:\n","role":"user"}],"gt_answer":["assert alternate_sq_sum([[]]) == [0]","assert alternate_sq_sum([[-1, 0, -3, 0, -5, 3]]) == [0]","assert alternate_sq_sum([[-1, 2, -3, 4, -5]]) == [11]","assert alternate_sq_sum([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]]) == [245]"],"fake_answer":["assert alternate_sq_sum([[]]) == [0]"],"hint":null,"answer":["assert alternate_sq_sum([[]]) == [0]","assert alternate_sq_sum([[-1, 0, -3, 0, -5, 3]]) == [0]","assert alternate_sq_sum([[-1, 2, -3, 4, -5]]) == [11]","assert alternate_sq_sum([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]]) == [245]"],"func_name":"alternate_sq_sum","setup_code":""}
